## Providers

| Name | Version |

| ibm | 1.13.1 |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| ibmcloud\_api\_key | IBM Cloud API key | `string` | true |
| name | A unique name for your collector. | `string` | true |
| is_public | Determines whether the collector endpoint is accessible on a public network. If set to `true`, the collector connects to resources in your account over a public network. If set to `false`, the collector connects to resources by using a private IP that is accessible only through the IBM Cloud private network. | `bool` | true |
| managed_by | Determines whether the collector is an IBM or customer-managed virtual machine. Use `ibm` to allow Security and Compliance Center to create, install, and manage the collector on your behalf. The collector is installed in an OpenShift cluster and approved automatically for use. Use `customer` if you would like to install the collector by using your own virtual machine. For more information, check out the [docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-collector). | `string` | true |
| description | A detailed description of the collector. | `string` | false |
| passphrase | To protect the credentials that you add to the service, a passphrase is used to generate a data encryption key. The key is used to securely store your credentials and prevent anyone from accessing them. | `string` | false |
| is_ubi_image | Determines whether the collector has a Ubi image. | `bool` | false |
| name | A unique name for your scope. | `string` | true |
| description | A detailed description of the scope. | `string` | true |
| collector_ids | The unique IDs of the collectors that are attached to the scope. | `list(string)` | true |
| credential_id | The unique identifier of the credential. | `string` | true |
| credential_type | The environment that the scope is targeted to. | `string` | true |
| interval | Stores the value of Frequency. This is used in case of on-prem Scope if the user wants to schedule a discovery task.The unit is seconds. Example if a user wants to trigger discovery every hour, this value will be set to 3600. | `number` | false |
| is_discovery_scheduled | Stores the value of Discovery Scheduled.This is used in case of on-prem Scope if the user wants to schedule a discovery task. | `bool` | false |
| enabled | Credentials status enabled/disbaled. | `bool` | true |
| type | Credentials type. | `string` | true |
| name | Credentials name. | `string` | true |
| description | Credentials description. | `string` | true |
| display_fields | Details the fields on the credential. This will change as per credential type selected. | `` | true |
| group | Credential group details. | `` | true |
| purpose | Purpose for which the credential is created. | `string` | true |
| id | The id for the given API. | `string` | true |
| profile_type | The profile type ID. This will be 4 for profiles and 6 for group profiles. | `string` | true |
| scan_id | The ID of the scan. | `string` | false |
| scan_id | Your Scan ID. | `string` | true |
| profile_id | The profile ID. This can be obtained from the Security and Compliance Center UI by clicking on the profile name. The URL contains the ID. | `string` | true |
| report_setting_id | The report setting ID. This can be obtained from the /validations/latest_scans API call. | `string` | true |
| profile_id | The profile ID. This can be obtained from the Security and Compliance Center UI by clicking on the profile name. The URL contains the ID. | `string` | true |
| correlation_id | A correlation_Id is created when a scope is created and discovery task is triggered or when a validation is triggered on a Scope. This is used to get the status of the task(discovery or validation). | `string` | true |
