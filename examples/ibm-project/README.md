  project_id = ibm_project.project_instance.project_id
  definition = var.project_config_definition
}
```
project resource:

resource "project" "project_instance" {
  location = var.project_location
  resource_group = var.project_resource_group
  definition = var.project_definition
}
```

## ProjectV1 data sources

project_config data source:

```hcl
data "project_config" "project_config_instance" {
  project_id = ibm_project.project_instance.id
  project_config_id = ibm_project_config.project_config_instance.project_config_id
}
```
project data source:

```hcl
