# Terraform for OpenShift Data Foundation

OpenShift Data Foundation is a highly available storage solution that you can use to manage persistent storage for your containerized workloads in Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud® clusters. This folder contains the different ways you can deploy and manage OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) on IBM Cloud through terraform.

## Deploying & Managing OpenShift Data Foundation on ROKS VPC

If you'd like to Deploy and Manage the different configurations for ODF on a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster (VPC) head over to the [addon](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/openshift-data-foundation/addon) folder.

## Updating or replacing VPC worker nodes that use OpenShift Data Foundation

If you'd like to update or replace the different worker nodes with ODF enabled, head over to the [vpc-worker-replace](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/openshift-data-foundation/vpc-worker-replace) folder. This inherently covers the worker replace steps of sequential cordon, drain, and replace.

## Deploying & Managing OpenShift Data Foundation on ROKS Satellite

If you'd like to Deploy and Manage ODF on a Red Hat OpenShift on a Satellite environment head over to the [satellite](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/openshift-data-foundation/satellite) folder.
