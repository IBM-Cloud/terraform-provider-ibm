| ibmcloud\_api\_key | IBM Cloud API key | `string` | true |
| project_id | The ID of the project. | `string` | true |
| image_reference | The name of the image that is used for this app or job. The format is `REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY:TAG` where `REGISTRY` and `TAG` are optional. If `REGISTRY` is not specified, the default is `docker.io`. If `TAG` is not specified, the default is `latest`. If the image reference points to a registry that requires authentication, make sure to also specify the property `image_secret`. | `string` | true |
| name | The name of the resource. | `string` | true |

| image_secret | Optional name of the image registry access secret. The image registry access secret is used to authenticate with a private registry when you download the container image. If the image reference points to a registry that requires authentication, the app will be created but cannot reach the ready status, until this property is provided, too. | `string` | false |
| managed_domain_mappings | Optional value controlling which of the system managed domain mappings will be setup for the application. Valid values are 'local_public', 'local_private' and 'local'. Visibility can only be 'local_private' if the project supports application private visibility. | `string` | false |

| source_context_dir | Option directory in the repository that contains the buildpacks file or the Dockerfile. | `string` | false |
| source_revision | Commit, tag, or branch in the source repository to pull. This field is optional if the `source_type` is `git` and uses the HEAD of default branch if not specified. If the `source_type` value is `local`, this field must be omitted. | `string` | false |
| source_secret | Name of the secret that is used access the repository source. This field is optional if the `source_type` is `git`. Additionally, if the `source_url` points to a repository that requires authentication, the build will be created but cannot access any source code, until this property is provided, too. If the `source_type` value is `local`, this field must be omitted. | `string` | false |

This property must not be set on a job run, which references a job template. | `string` | false |
| run_mode | The mode for runs of the job. Valid values are `task` and `daemon`. In `task` mode, the `scale_max_execution_time` and `scale_retry_limit` properties apply. In `daemon` mode, since there is no timeout and failed instances are restarted indefinitely, the `scale_max_execution_time` and `scale_retry_limit` properties are not allowed. | `string` | false |
| scale_array_spec | Define a custom set of array indices as comma-separated list containing single values and hyphen-separated ranges like `5,12-14,23,27`. Each instance can pick up its array index via environment variable `JOB_INDEX`. The number of unique array indices specified here determines the number of job instances to run. | `string` | false |
