# IBM Cloud Provider

The IBM Cloud provider is used to manage IBM Cloud resources. The provider must be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation menu on the left to read about the available data sources and resources.

## Example Usage of Provider

Terraform 0.13 and later:
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ibm = {
      source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
      version = "~> 1.12.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the IBM Provider
provider "ibm" {
  region = "us-south"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "test-vpc"
}

```

Terraform 0.12 and earlier:
```terraform
# Configure the IBM Provider

provider "ibm" {
  version = "~> 1.12.0"
  region = "us-south"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "test-vpc"
}
```
Visiblity support:
```terraform
# Configure the IBM Provider

provider "ibm" {
  visibility = "private"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "test-vpc"
}
```
## Example Usage of Resources:

```terraform

# Create an IBM Cloud infrastructure SSH key. You can find the SSH key surfaces in the infrastructure console under Devices > Manage > SSH Keys
resource "ibm_compute_ssh_key" "test_key_1" {
  label      = "test_key_1"
  public_key = var.ssh_public_key
}

# Create a virtual server with the SSH key
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "my_server_2" {
  hostname          = "host-b.example.com"
  domain            = "example.com"
  ssh_key_ids       = [123456, ibm_compute_ssh_key.test_key_1.id]
  os_reference_code = "CENTOS_6_64"
  datacenter        = "ams01"
  network_speed     = 10
  cores             = 1
  memory            = 1024
}

# Reference details of the IBM Cloud space
data "ibm_space" "space" {
  space = var.space
  org   = var.org
}

# Create an instance of an IBM service
resource "ibm_service_instance" "service" {
  name       = var.instance_name
  space_guid = data.ibm_space.space.id
  service    = "speech_to_text"
  plan       = "lite"
  tags       = ["cluster-service", "cluster-bind"]
}

# Create a Cloud Functions action
resource "ibm_function_action" "nodehello" {
  name      = "action-name"
  namespace = "function-namespace-name"
  exec {
    kind = "nodejs:10"
    code = file("hellonode.js")
  }
}

# Create a IS VPC and instance
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "testvpc1"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "testacc_subnet" {
  name            = "testsubnet1"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.testacc_vpc.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "testacc_sshkey" {
  name       = "testssh1"
  public_key = "<your_public_ssh_key>"
}

resource "ibm_is_instance" "testacc_instance" {
  name    = "testinstance1"
  image   = "7eb4e35b-4257-56f8-d7da-326d85452591"
  profile = "b-2x8"

  primary_network_interface {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.testacc_subnet.id
  }

  vpc       = ibm_is_vpc.testacc_vpc.id
  zone      = "us-south-1"
  keys      = [ibm_is_ssh_key.testacc_sshkey.id]
  user_data = file("nginx.sh")
}

resource "ibm_is_floating_ip" "testacc_floatingip" {
  name   = "testfip"
  target = ibm_is_instance.testacc_instance.primary_network_interface[0].id
}

```

## Authentication

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static credentials ###

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:

```shell
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```
***Note:***
1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  * Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  * Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For `iaas_classic_username` 
  * Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  * Click on user.
  * Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab


## Argument Reference

You can also source it from the `MAX_RETRIES` environment variable. The default value is `10`.

* `function_namespace` - (Optional) Your Cloud Functions namespace is composed from your IBM Cloud org and space like \<org\>_\<space\>. This attribute is required only when creating a Cloud Functions resource. It must be provided when you are creating such resources in IBM Cloud. You can also source it from the FUNCTION_NAMESPACE environment variable.

* `riaas_endpoint` - (deprected, Optional) The next generation infrastructure service API endpoint . It can also be sourced from the `RIAAS_ENDPOINT`. Default value: `us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com`. 

* `generation` - (deprected, Optional) The generation is deprecated by default the provider targets to the IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure.

* `zone` - (optional) The IBM Cloud zone for a region. You can also source it from the `IC_ZONE` (higher precedence) or `IBMCLOUD_ZONE` environment variable. This value is required for power resources if the region supports multi-zone. For region `eu-de` it supports two zones `eu-de-1` and `eu-de-2`. Set the region and zone for the Power Virtual Server.

* `visibility` - (Optional) The visibility to IBM Cloud endpoint - `public`, `private`, `public-and-private`. Default value: `public`. Allowable values are `public`, `private`, `public-and-private`.
    * If visibility is set to `public`, use the regional public endpoint or global public endpoint. The regional public endpoints has higher precedence.
    * If visibility is set to `private`, use the regional private endpoint or global private endpoint. The regional private endpoint is given higher precedence.  In order to use the private endpoint from an IBM Cloud resource (such as, a classic VM instance), one must have VRF-enabled account.  If the Cloud service does not support private endpoint, the terraform resource or datasource will log an error.
    * If visibility is set to `public-and-private`, use regional private endpoints or global private endpoint. If service doesn't support regional or global private endpoints it will use the regional or global public endpoint.
    * This can also be sourced from the `IC_VISIBILITY` (higher precedence) or `IBMCLOUD_VISIBILITY` environment variable.


***Note***
The CloudFoundry endpoint has been updated in this release of IBM Cloud Terraform provider v0.17.4.  If you are using an earlier version of IBM Cloud Terraform provider, export the `IBMCLOUD_UAA_ENDPOINT` to the new authentication endpoint, as illustrated below

```shell
export IBMCLOUD_UAA_ENDPOINT="https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/cloudfoundry/login/<region>/"
```
