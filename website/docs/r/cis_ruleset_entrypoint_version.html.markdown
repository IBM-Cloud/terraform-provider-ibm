# ibm_cis_ruleset_entrypoint_version

Provides an IBM Cloud Internet Services ruleset entrypoint version resource to create and update the ruleset entrypoint of an instance or domain. This entrypoint version is also used to deploy the managed ruleset and to add custom rules. For more information, about the IBM Cloud Internet Services ruleset entrypoint version, see [ruleset entrypoint instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-managed-rules-overview). To manage rules individually, you can also use [ruleset rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/cis_ruleset_rule).

## Example usage

```terraform
# create entrypoint ruleset for a domain.

  resource "ibm_cis_ruleset_entrypoint_version" "test" {
    cis_id    = ibm_cis.instance.id
    domain_id = data.ibm_cis_domain.cis_domain.domain_id
    phase = "http_request_firewall_managed"
    rulesets {
      description = "Entrypoint ruleset for managed ruleset"
    }
  }

# Create/Update entrypoint ruleset and deploy managed ruleset.

  resource "ibm_cis_ruleset_entrypoint_version" "test" {
    cis_id    = ibm_cis.instance.id
    domain_id = data.ibm_cis_domain.cis_domain.domain_id
    phase = "http_request_firewall_managed"
    rulesets {
      description = "Entrypoint ruleset for managed ruleset"
      rules {

```

**Note**: If an update is required in a particular rule, you must still provide the data for other rules. Otherwise, the new update overrides the previous configuration. To add or update an individual rule, see the resource [ruleset rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/cis_ruleset_rule).

## Attribute reference

There are no attribute references in addition to the argument reference list.

## Import

The `ibm_cis_ruleset_entrypoint_version` resource is imported by using the ID. The ID is formed from the ruleset phase, the domain ID of the domain, and the Cloud Resource Name (CRN) concatenated using a `:` character.

The domain ID and CRN are located on the **Overview** page of the Internet Services instance of the domain heading of the console, or by using the `ibm cis` CLI commands.

- **Ruleset Phase** is a string of the form: `http_request_firewall_managed`.

- **Domain ID** is a 32-digit character string of the form: `9caf68812ae9b3f0377fdf986751a78f`.

- **CRN** is a 120-digit character string of the form: `crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:31fa970d-51d0-4b05-893e-251cba75a7b3::`.
