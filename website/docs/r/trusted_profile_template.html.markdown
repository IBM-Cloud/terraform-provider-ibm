			* `value` - (Required, String) The stringified JSON value that the claim is compared to using the operator.
		* `expiration` - (Optional, Integer) Session expiration in seconds, only required if type is 'Profile-SAML'.
		* `name` - (Optional, String) Name of the claim rule to be created or updated.
