# ibm\_is_bare_metal_server

Create, update, or delete a Bare Metal Server for VPC. For more information, about managing VPC Bare Metal Server, see [About Bare Metal Servers for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-bare-metal-servers).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create a Bare Metal Server:

### Basic Example
```terraform

resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name            = "example-subnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.vpc.id
  zone            = "us-south-3"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.129.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "example" {
  name       = "example-ssh"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCKVmnMOlHKcZK8tpt3MP1lqOLAcqcJzhsvJcjscgVERRN7/9484SOBJ3HSKxxNG5JN8owAjy5f9yYwcUg+JaUVuytn5Pv3aeYROHGGg+5G346xaq3DAwX6Y5ykr2fvjObgncQBnuU5KHWCECO/4h8uWuwh/kfniXPVjFToc+gnkqA+3RKpAecZhFXwfalQ9mMuYGFxn+fwn8cYEApsJbsEmb0iJwPiZ5hjFC8wREuiTlhPHDgkBLOiycd20op2nXzDbHfCHInquEe/gYxEitALONxm0swBOwJZwlTDOB7C6y2dzlrtxr1L59m7pCkWI4EtTRLvleehBoj3u7jB4usR"
}

resource "ibm_is_bare_metal_server" "example" {
  profile = "mx2d-metal-32x192"
  name    = "example-bms"
  image   = "r134-31c8ca90-2623-48d7-8cf7-737be6fc4c3e"
  zone    = "us-south-3"
  keys    = [ibm_is_ssh_key.example.id]
  primary_network_interface {
    subnet     = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  }
  vpc   = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
}

```
### Reserved ip example
```terraform
resource "ibm_is_bare_metal_server" "bms" {
  profile = "mx2d-metal-32x192"
  name    = "example-bms"
  image   = "r134-31c8ca90-2623-48d7-8cf7-737be6fc4c3e"
  zone    = "us-south-3"
  keys    = [ibm_is_ssh_key.example.id]
  primary_network_interface {
    subnet     = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    primary_ip {
      auto_delete = true
      name        = "example-reserved-ip"
      address     = "${replace(ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block, "0/28", "14")}"
    }
  }
  vpc   = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
}

```

## Timeouts

ibm_is_bare-metal_server provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

- `create` - (Default 30 minutes) Used for creating bare metal server.
- `update` - (Default 30 minutes) Used for updating bare metal server or while attaching it with volume attachments or interfaces.
- `delete` - (Default 30 minutes) Used for deleting bare metal server.

## Argument Reference

Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `delete_type` - (Optional, String) Type of deletion on destroy. **soft** signals running operating system to quiesce and shutdown cleanly, **hard** immediately stop the server. By default its `hard`.
- `image` - (Required, String) ID of the image.
- `keys` - (Required, List) Comma separated IDs of ssh keys.  
- `name` - (Optional, String) The bare metal server name.

  -> **NOTE:**
    a bare metal server can take up to 30 mins to clean up on delete, replacement/re-creation using the same name may return error

- `network_interfaces` - (Optional, List) The additional network interfaces to create for the bare metal server to this bare metal server. Use `ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_interface` &  `ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_interface_allow_float` resource for network interfaces.

  ~> **NOTE:**
    creating network interfaces both inline with `ibm_is_bare_metal_server` & as a separate `ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_interface` resource, will show change alternatively on both resources, to avoid this use `ibm_is_bare_metal_server_network_interface` for creating network interfaces.
  
  Nested scheme for `network_interfaces`:
    - `allow_ip_spoofing` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If false, IP spoofing is prevented on this interface. If true, IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. [default : `false`]
