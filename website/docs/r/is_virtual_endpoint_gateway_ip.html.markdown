# ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway_ip
Create, update, or delete a VPC endpoint gateway IP by using virtual endpoint gateway resource. For more information, about the VPC endpoint gateway, see [about VPC gateways](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
The following example creates a Virtual Private Endpoint gateway IP.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway_ip" "example" {
  gateway     = ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateway.example.id
  reserved_ip = ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip.example.reserved_ip
}
```


## Argument reference
