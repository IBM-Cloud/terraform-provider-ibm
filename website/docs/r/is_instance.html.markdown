# ibm_is_instance
Create, update, or delete a Virtual Servers for VPC instance. For more information, about managing VPC instance, see [about virtual server instances for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).

**Note**
- IBM Cloud terraform provider currently provides both a standalone `ibm_is_instance_network_interface` resource and a `network_interfaces` block defined in-line in the `ibm_is_instance` resource. At this time you cannot use the `network_interfaces` block inline with `ibm_is_instance` in conjunction with the standalone resource `ibm_is_instance_network_interface`. Doing so will create a conflict of network interfaces and will overwrite it.
- VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

  **provider.tf**

  ```terraform
  provider "ibm" {
    region = "eu-gb"
  }
  ```

## Example usage

### Sample for creating an instance in a VPC using virtual network interface and network attachments.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

  value = ibm_is_instance.example.primary_network_interface.0.primary_ip.0.address // use this instead 
}

```
### Sample for creating an instance with reserved ip as primary_ip reference.

The following example shows how you can create a virtual server instance using reserved ip as the primary ip reference of the network interface

// Example to provision instance using reserved ip

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "example" {
  subnet    = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  name      = "example-reserved-ip1"
  address		= "${replace(ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block, "0/24", "13")}"
}

resource "ibm_is_instance" "example1" {
  name    = "example-instance-reserved-ip"
  image   = ibm_is_image.example.id
  profile = "bc1-2x8"
  metadata_service_enabled  = false

  primary_network_interface {
    name   = "eth0"
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    primary_ip {
      reserved_ip = ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip.example.reserved_ip
    }
  }  
  network_interfaces {
    name   = "eth1"
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    allow_ip_spoofing = false
    primary_ip {
      name = "example-reserved-ip1"
      auto_delete = true
      address = "${replace(ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block, "0/24", "14")}"
    }
  }

  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone = "us-south-1"
  keys = [ibm_is_ssh_key.example.id]
}

```

### Sample for creating an instance in a VPC with reservation

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_reservation" "example" {
  capacity {
    total = 5
  }
  committed_use {
    term = "one_year"
  }
  profile {
    name          = "ba2-2x8"
    resource_type = "instance_profile"
  }
  zone = "us-east-3"
  name = "reservation-name"
}

resource "ibm_is_instance" "example" {
  name    = "example-instance"
  image   = ibm_is_image.example.id
  profile = "bx2-2x8"
  metadata_service_enabled  = false
  primary_network_interface {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  }
  reservation_affinity {
    policy = "manual"
    pool {
      id = ibm_is_reservation.example.id
    }
  }
  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone = "us-south-1"
  keys = [ibm_is_ssh_key.example.id]

  //User can configure timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}

```
### Sample for creating an instance with custom security group rules.

The following example shows how you can create a virtual server instance with custom security group rules. Note that the security group, security group rules, and the virtual server instance must be created in a specific order to meet the dependencies of the individual resources. To force the creation in a specific order, you use the [`depends_on` parameter](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html). If you do not provide this parameter, all resources are created at the same time which might lead to resource dependency errors during the provisioning of your virtual server, such as `The security group to attach to is not available`.

~>**Conflict** 
 IBM Cloud terraform provider currently provides both a standalone `ibm_is_security_group_target` resource and a `security_groups` block defined in-line in the `ibm_is_instance` resource to attach security group to a network interface target. At this time you cannot use the `security_groups` block inline with `ibm_is_instance` in conjunction with the standalone resource `ibm_is_security_group_target`. </br> Doing so will create a **conflict of security groups** attaching to the network interface and will overwrite it.

```terraform

resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"

## Timeouts

The `ibm_is_instance` resource provides the following [[Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:


- **create**: The creation of the instance is considered failed when no response is received for 30 minutes.
- **update**: The update of the instance or the attachment of a volume to an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 30 minutes.
- **delete**: The deletion of the instance is considered failed when no response is received for 30 minutes.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource.

- `access_tags`  - (Optional, List of Strings) A list of access management tags to attach to the instance.

  ~> **Note:** 
  **&#x2022;** You can attach only those access tags that already exists.</br>
  **&#x2022;** For more information, about creating access tags, see [working with tags](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=ui#create-access-console).</br>
  **&#x2022;** You must have the access listed in the [Granting users access to tag resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access) for `access_tags`</br>
  **&#x2022;** `access_tags` must be in the format `key:value`.
- `action` - (Optional, String) Action to be taken on the instance. Supported values are `stop`, `start`, or `reboot`.
  
  ~> **Note** 
    `action` allows to start, stop and reboot the instance and it is not recommended to manage the instance from terraform and other clients (UI/CLI) simultaneously, as it would cause unknown behaviour. `start` action can be performed only when the instance is in `stopped` state. `stop` and `reboot` actions can be performed only when the instance is in `running` state. It is also recommended to remove the `action` configuration from terraform once it is applied succesfully, to avoid instability in the terraform configuration later.
- `auto_delete_volume`- (Optional, Bool) If set to **true**, automatically deletes the volumes that are attached to an instance. **Note** Setting this argument can bring some inconsistency in the volume resource, as the volumes is destroyed along with instances.
- `availability_policy_host_failure` - (Optional, String) The availability policy to use for this virtual server instance. The action to perform if the compute host experiences a failure. Supported values are `restart` and `stop`.
- `boot_volume`  (Optional, List) A list of boot volumes for an instance.

  Nested scheme for `boot_volume`:
  - `auto_delete_volume` - (Optional, String) If set to **true**, when deleting the instance the volume will also be deleted
  - `encryption` - (Optional, String) The type of encryption to use for the boot volume.
