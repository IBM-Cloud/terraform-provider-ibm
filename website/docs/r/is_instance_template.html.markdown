# ibm_is_instance_template
Create, update, or delete an instance template on VPC. For more information, about instance template, see [managing an instance template](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-instance-template).

~>**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

      - `subnet` - (Required, String) The subnet id of the virtual network interface for the network attachment.

- `network_interfaces` - (Optional, List) A nested block describes the network interfaces for the template.

  Nested scheme for `network_interfaces`:
	- `allow_ip_spoofing`- (Optional, Bool) Indicates whether IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If set to **false** IP spoofing is prevented on the interface. If set to **true**, IP spoofing is allowed on the interface.
	- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the interface.
	- `primary_ipv4_address` - (Optional, String) The IPv4 address assigned to the network interface.
  - `security_groups` - (Optional, List) List of security groups of the subnet.
  - `subnet` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The VPC subnet to assign to the interface.
- `reservation_affinity` - (Optional, List) The reservation affinity for the instance
  Nested scheme for `reservation_affinity`:
  - `policy` - (Optional, String) The reservation affinity policy to use for this virtual server instance.

     ->**policy** 
			&#x2022; disabled: Reservations will not be used
      </br>&#x2022; manual: Reservations in pool will be available for use
  - `pool` - (Optional, String) The pool of reservations available for use by this virtual server instance. Specified reservations must have a status of active, and have the same profile and zone as this virtual server instance. The pool must be empty if policy is disabled, and must not be empty if policy is manual.
    Nested scheme for `pool`:
    - `id` - The unique identifier for this reservation
- `resource_group` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The resource group ID.
- `total_volume_bandwidth` - (Optional, int) The amount of bandwidth (in megabits per second) allocated exclusively to instance storage volumes
- `volume_attachments` - (Optional, Force new resource, List) A nested block describes the storage volume configuration for the template. 

  Nested scheme for `volume_attachments`:
	- `delete_volume_on_instance_delete`- (Required, Bool) You can configure to delete the storage volume to delete based on instance deletion.
  - `name` - (Required, String) The name of the boot volume.
	- `volume` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The storage volume ID created in VPC.
  - `volume_prototype` - (Optional, Forces new resource, List)

      Nested scheme for `volume_prototype`:
      - `capacity` - (Required, Forces new resource, Integer) The capacity of the volume in gigabytes. The specified minimum and maximum capacity values for creating or updating volumes may expand in the future.
      - `encryption_key` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The CRN of the [Key Protect Root Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-getting-started-tutorial) or [Hyper Protect Crypto Service Root Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-get-started) for the resource.
      - `iops` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Integer) The maximum input and output operations per second (IOPS) for the volume.
      - `profile` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The global unique name for the volume profile to use for the volume. Allowed values areFor more information, about volume profiles, see [volume profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles)
      - `tags`- (Optional, Array of Strings) A list of user tags that you want to add to your volume. (https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/tagging#types-of-tags)
      
      ~>**Note:** 
      `volume_attachments` provides either `volume` with a storage volume ID, or `volume_prototype` to create a new volume. If you plan to use this template with instance group, provide the `volume_prototype`. Instance group does not support template with existing storage volume IDs.
- `vpc` - (Required, String) The VPC ID that the instance templates needs to be created.
- `user_data` -  (Optional, String) The user data provided for the instance.
- `zone` - (Required, String) The name of the zone.

- `id` - (String) The ID of an instance template.
- `catalog_offering` - (List) The [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-restrict-by-user&interface=ui) offering or offering version to use when provisioning this virtual server instance. If an offering is specified, the latest version of that offering will be used. The specified offering or offering version may be in a different account in the same [enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-what-is-enterprise), subject to IAM policies.

  Nested scheme for `catalog_offering`:
    - `offering_crn` - (String) The CRN for this catalog offering. Identifies a catalog offering by this unique property
    - `version_crn` - (String) The CRN for this version of a catalog offering. Identifies a version of a catalog offering by this unique property
	- `plan_crn` - (String) The CRN for this catalog offering version's billing plan
