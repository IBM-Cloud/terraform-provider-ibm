## Import

You can import the `ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_custom` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `toolchain_id`, and `tool_id` in the following format:

```
<toolchain_id>/<tool_id>
```
* `toolchain_id`: A string. ID of the toolchain to bind the tool to.
* `tool_id`: A string. ID of the tool bound to the toolchain.

# Syntax
```
$ terraform import ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_custom.cd_toolchain_tool_custom <toolchain_id>/<tool_id>
```
