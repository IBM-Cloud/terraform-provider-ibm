# ibm_resource_key
Create, update, or delete service credentials for an IAM-enabled service. By default, the `ibm_resource_key` resource creates service credentials that use the public service endpoint of a service. To create service credentials that use the private service endpoint instead, you must explicitly define that by using the `parameter` argument parameter. Note that your service might not support private service endpoints yet. For more information, about resource key, see [adding and viewing credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials).

## Example usage
The following example enables to create credentials for a resource without a service ID.

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name = "myobjectsotrage"
}

resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "myobjectkey"
  role                 = "Viewer"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```

**Note** The current `ibm_resource_key` resource doesn't have support for service_id argument but the service_id can be passed as one of the parameter.

### Example to create by using serviceID 

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name = "myobjectsotrage"
}

resource "ibm_iam_service_id" "serviceID" {
  name        = "test"
  description = "New ServiceID"
}

resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "myobjectkey"
  role                 = "Viewer"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id
  parameters = {
    "serviceid_crn" = ibm_iam_service_id.serviceID.crn
  }

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```
### Example to create by using HMAC 

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
    name ="Default"
}
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name              = "test-21"
  service           = "cloud-object-storage"
  plan              = "lite"
  location          = "global"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]
  
  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
resource "ibm_resource_key" "resourceKey" {
  name                 = "my-cos-bucket-xx-key"
  resource_instance_id = ibm_resource_instance.resource_instance.id
  parameters           = { "HMAC" = true }
  role                 = "Manager"
}

```

## Timeouts

The `ibm_resource_key` provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for Creating Key.
- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for Deleting Key.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

 - `name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String)  A descriptive name used to identify a resource key.
 - `parameters` (Optional, Map) Arbitrary parameters to pass to the resource in JSON format. If you want to create service credentials by using the private service endpoint, include the `service-endpoints =  "private"` parameter.
- `role` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The name of the user role. Valid roles are `Writer`, `Reader`, `Manager`, `Administrator`, `Operator`, `Viewer`, and `Editor`.
- `resource_instance_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the resource instance associated with the resource key. **Note** Conflicts with `resource_alias_id`.
- `resource_alias_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the resource alias associated with the resource key. **Note** Conflicts with `resource_instance_id`.
- `tags` (Optional, Array of strings) Tags associated with the resource key instance. **Note** Tags are managed locally and not stored on the IBM Cloud Service Endpoint at this moment.


## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `account_id` - (String) An alpha-numeric value identifying the account ID.
- `credentials` - (String) The credentials associated with the key.
- `created_at` - (Timestamp) The date when the key was created.
- `created_by` - (String) The subject who created the key.
- `crn` - (String) The full Cloud Resource Name (CRN) associated with the key.
- `deleted_at` - (Timestamp) The date when the key was deleted.
- `deleted_by` - (String) The subject who deleted the key.
- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the new resource key.
- `status` - (String) The status of the resource key.
- `guid` - (String) A unique internal identifier GUID managed by the resource controller that corresponds to the key.
- `iam_compatible` - (String) Specifies whether the keyâ€™s credentials support IAM.
- `resource_group_id` - (String) The short ID of the resource group.
- `source_crn` - (String) The CRN of resource instance or alias associated to the key.
- `state` - (String) The state of the key.
- `resource_instance_url` - (String) The relative path to the resource.
- `updated_at` - (Timestamp) The date when the key was last updated.
- `updated_by` - (String) The subject who updated the key.
- `url` - (String) When you created a new key, a relative URL path is created identifying the location of the key.
