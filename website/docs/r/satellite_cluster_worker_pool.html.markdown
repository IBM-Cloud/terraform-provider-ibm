# ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool

Create, update, or delete the Satellite cluster worker pool. The worker pool will be attached to the specified cluster[IBM Cloud Satellite Cluster Worker Pool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-autoassign-ov).

## Example usage

###  Create satellite cluster worker pool

```terraform
resource "ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool" "create_cluster_wp" {
	name               = var.worker_pool_name
	cluster	           = var.cluster
	worker_count       = var.worker_count 
	resource_group_id  = data.ibm_resource_group.rg.id
	dynamic "zones" {
		for_each = var.zones
		content {
      		id	= zones.value
    	}
  	}
	host_labels        = var.host_labels
}	
```

###  Create satellite cluster worker pool without workers

```terraform
resource "ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool" "create_cluster_wp" {
	name               = var.worker_pool_name
	cluster	           = data.ibm_satellite_cluster.read_cluster.id
	dynamic "zones" {
		for_each = var.zones
		content {
      		id	= zones.value
    	}
  	}
}	
```

## Timeouts

The `ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool` provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- `create` - (Default 120 minutes) Used for creating Instance.
- `read`   - (Default 10 minutes) Used for reading Instance.
- `update` - (Default 120 minutes) Used for updating Instance.
- `delete` - (Default 90 minutes) Used for deleting Instance.


## Argument reference

Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The name of the worker pool.
- `cluster` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The name or id of the cluster.
- `operating_system` - (Optional, String) Operating system of the worker pool. Options are REDHAT_7_64, REDHAT_8_64, or RHCOS.
- `worker_count` - (Optional, Integer) The number of worker nodes per zone in the worker pool.
- `flavor` - (Optional, String) The flavor defines the amount of virtual CPU, memory, and disk space that is set up in each worker node.
- `isolation` - (Optional, String) Isolation for the worker node.
- `disk_encryption` - (Optional, String) Disk encryption for worker node.
- `zones` - (Required, List) A nested block describing the zones of this worker_pool. 

  Nested scheme for `zones`:
  - `id` - (Required, String) The name of the zone.
- `host_labels` - (Optional, Array of Strings) Key-value pairs to label the host, such as cpu=4 to describe the host capabilities.
- `worker_pool_labels` - Labels on all the workers in the worker pool.
- `resource_group_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the resource group.  You can retrieve the value from data source 
- `entitlement` - (Optional, String) The openshift cluster entitlement avoids the OCP licence charges incurred. Use cloud paks with OCP Licence entitlement to add the Openshift cluster worker pool.

## Attribute reference

In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the worker pool resource. The `id` is composed of \<cluster_name_id\>/\<worker_pool_id\>.<br/>

**Note**

Host assignment to workerpool:

-  When you attach a host to a Satellite location, the host automatically assigned to worker pools in satellite resources.
   Auto-assignment works based on matching host labels (https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-autoassign-ov).
-  For manual assignment, Use `ibm_satellite_host` resource to assign the host to workerpools.

## Import

The `ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool` can be imported by using `cluster_name_id` and `worker_pool_id`.

**Example**

```
$ terraform import ibm_satellite_cluster_worker_pool.example mycluster/5c4f4d06e0dc402084922dea70850e3b-7cafe35
