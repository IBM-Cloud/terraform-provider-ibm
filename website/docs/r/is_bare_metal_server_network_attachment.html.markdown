## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

- `allow_to_float` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates if the bare metal server network attachment can automatically float to any other server within the same `resource_group`. The bare metal server network attachment will float automatically if the network detects a GARP or RARP on another bare metal server in the resource group. Applies only to bare metal server network attachments with `vlan` interface type.
- `allowed_vlans` - (Optional, List) Indicates what VLAN IDs (for VLAN type only) can use this physical (PCI type) attachment.
- `bare_metal_server` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The bare metal server identifier.
- `interface_type` - (Required, String) The network attachment's interface type:- `hipersocket`: a virtual network device that provides high-speed TCP/IP connectivity  within a `s390x` based system- `pci`: a physical PCI device which can only be created or deleted when the bare metal  server is stopped  - Has an `allowed_vlans` property which controls the VLANs that will be permitted    to use the PCI attachment  - Cannot directly use an IEEE 802.1q VLAN tag.- `vlan`: a virtual device, used through a `pci` device that has the `vlan` in its  array of `allowed_vlans`.  - Must use an IEEE 802.1q tag.The enumerated values for this property are expected to expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name for this bare metal server network attachment. The name is unique across all network attachments for the bare metal server.
- `virtual_network_interface` - (Optional, List) The virtual network interface for this bare metal server network attachment.
	Nested schema for **virtual_network_interface**:
    - `allow_ip_spoofing` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If `false`, source IP spoofing is prevented on this interface. If `true`, source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface.
    - `auto_delete` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether this virtual network interface will be automatically deleted when`target` is deleted.
    - `enable_infrastructure_nat` - (Optional, Boolean) If `true`:- The VPC infrastructure performs any needed NAT operations.- `floating_ips` must not have more than one floating IP. If `false`:- Packets are passed unchanged to/from the network interface,  allowing the workload to perform any needed NAT operations.- `allow_ip_spoofing` must be `false`.- If the virtual network interface is attached:  - The target `resource_type` must be `bare_metal_server_network_attachment`.  - The target `interface_type` must not be `hipersocket`.
