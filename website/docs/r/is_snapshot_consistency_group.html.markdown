# ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group

Create, update, and delete SnapshotConsistencyGroups with this resource. For more information, about snapshot consistency group, see [creating snapshot consistency group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-create).

**Note**
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group" "is_snapshot_consistency_group" {
  delete_snapshots_on_delete = true
  snapshots {
    name          = "example-snapshot"
    source_volume = ibm_is_instance.testacc_instance.volume_attachments[0].volume_id
  }
  name = "example-snapshot-consistency-group"
}
```

## Argument Reference
