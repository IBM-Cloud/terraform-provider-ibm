# ibm_cbr_zone

Provides a resource for cbr_zone. This allows cbr_zone to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_cbr_zone" "cbr_zone" {
  account_id = "12ab34cd56ef78ab90cd12ef34ab56cd"
  addresses {
		type = "ipAddress"
		value = "value"
  }
  description = "this is an example of zone"
  excluded {
		type = "ipAddress"
		value = "value"
  }
  name = "an example of zone"
}
```

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  - Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  - Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For iaas_classic_username
  - Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  - Click on user.
  - Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab

For more informaton, see [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs#authentication).

## Import

You can import the `ibm_cbr_zone` resource by using `id`. The globally unique ID of the zone.

# Syntax
```
$ terraform import ibm_cbr_zone.cbr_zone <id>
```
