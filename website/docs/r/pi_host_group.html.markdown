# ibm_pi_host_group

Create, update, and delete host group with this resource. For more information, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example Usage

The following example enables you to create a host group:

```terraform
resource "ibm_pi_host_group" "hostGroup" {
    pi_cloud_instance_id  = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
    pi_hosts =  {
        display_name = "display_name"
        sys_type = "sys_type"
    }
    pi_name = "name"
    pi_secondaries = {
        name = "name"
        workspace = "workspace"
    }
}
```

### Notes

* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  
  Example usage:
  
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
