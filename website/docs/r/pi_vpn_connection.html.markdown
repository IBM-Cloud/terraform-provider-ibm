# ibm_pi_vpn_connection
Create, update, or delete a VPN connection. For more information, about IBM power virtual server cloud, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example usage
The following example creates a VPN Connection.

```terraform
	resource "ibm_pi_vpn_connection" "example" {
		pi_cloud_instance_id    = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
		pi_vpn_connection_name  = "test"
		pi_ike_policy_id        = ibm_pi_ike_policy.policy.policy_id
		pi_ipsec_policy_id      = ibm_pi_ipsec_policy.policy.policy_id
		pi_vpn_connection_mode  = "policy"
		pi_networks             = [ibm_pi_network.private_network1.network_id]
		pi_peer_gateway_address = "1.22.124.1"
		pi_peer_subnets         = ["107.0.0.0/24"]
	}
```

**Note**
* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`

  Example usage:
  
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the VPN Connection. The ID is composed of `<power_instance_id>/<vpn_connection_id>`.
- `connection_id` - (String) VPN Connection ID.
- `connection_status` - (String) Status of the VPN connection.
- `dead_peer_detections` - (Map) Dead Peer Detection.

  Nested scheme for `dead_peer_detections`:
  - `action` - (String) Action to take when a Peer Gateway stops responding.
  - `interval` - (String) How often to test that the Peer Gateway is responsive.
  - `threshold` - (String) The number of attempts to connect before tearing down the connection.
- `gateway_address` - (String) Public IP address of the VPN Gateway (vSRX) attached to this VPN Connection.
- `local_gateway_address` - (String) Local Gateway address, only in `route` mode.


## Import
