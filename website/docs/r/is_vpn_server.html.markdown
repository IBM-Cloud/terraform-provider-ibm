# ibm_is_vpn_server

Provides a resource for VPNServer. This allows VPNServer to be created, updated and deleted. For more information, about VPN Server, see [Creating a VPN server](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-server&interface=ui).

## Example Usage
The following example creates a VPN Server:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpn_server" "example" {
  certificate_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudcerts:us-south:a/efe5afc483594adaa8325e2b4d1290df:86f62739-f3a8-42ac-abea-f23255965983:certificate:00406b5615f95dba9bf7c2ab52bb3083"
  client_authentication {
    method    = "certificate"
    client_ca_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudcerts:us-south:a/efe5afc483594adaa8325e2b4d1290df:86f62739-f3a8-42ac-abea-f23255965983:certificate:00406b5615f95dba9bf7c2ab52bb3083"
  }
  client_ip_pool         = "10.5.0.0/21"
  client_dns_server_ips  = ["192.168.3.4"]
  client_idle_timeout    = 2800
  enable_split_tunneling = false
  name                   = "example-vpn-server"
  port                   = 443
  protocol               = "udp"
  subnets                = [ibm_is_subnet.subnet1.id]
}
```

## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_vpn_server` resource provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create**: The creation of the VPN server is considered `failed` when no response is received for 10 minutes. 
- **update**: The update of the VPN server is considered `failed` when no response is received for 10 minutes. 
- **delete**: The deletion of the VPN server is considered `failed` when no response is received for 10 minutes. 

## Argument Reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `access_tags`  - (Optional, List of Strings) A list of access management tags to attach to the vpn server.

  ~> **Note:** 
  **&#x2022;** You can attach only those access tags that already exists.</br>
  **&#x2022;** For more information, about creating access tags, see [working with tags](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=ui#create-access-console).</br>
  **&#x2022;** You must have the access listed in the [Granting users access to tag resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access) for `access_tags`</br>
  **&#x2022;** `access_tags` must be in the format `key:value`.
- `certificate_crn` - (Required, String) The certificate CRN of secret from Secrets Manager for this VPN server. 

  !> **Removal Notification** Certificate Manager support is removed, please use Secrets Manager.

- `client_authentication` - (Required, List) The methods used to authenticate VPN clients to this VPN server.
  
  Nested scheme for **client_authentication**:

	  - Constraints: Allowable values are: certificate, username
    
   -> **NOTE:** 
      `identity_provider` and `client_ca_crn` are mutually exclusive, which means either one must be provided. When `method` has `certificate` as value `client_ca_crn` must be provided and when `method` has `username` as value `identity_provider` must be provided.

	- `identity_provider` - (Required, String) The type of identity provider to be used by VPN client.The type of identity provider to be used by the VPN client.- `iam`: IBM identity and access management The enumerated values for this property are expected to expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the route on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
		  - Constraints: Allowable values are: iam
	- `client_ca_crn` - (Required, String)  The CRN of the certificate instance or CRN of the secret from secrets manager to use for the VPN client certificate authority (CA). As the usage of certificate CRN from Certificate Manager is getting deprecated, It is recommended to use Secret manger for same.
- `client_dns_server_ips` - (Optional, List) The IP address. This property may add support for IPv6 addresses in the future. When processing a value in this property, verify that the address is in an expected format. If it is not, log an error. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected IP address format was encountered, the DNS server addresses that will be provided to VPN clients connected to this VPN server.
- `client_idle_timeout` - (Optional, Integer) The seconds a VPN client can be idle before this VPN server will disconnect it.   Specify `0` to prevent the server from disconnecting idle clients.
  - Constraints: The maximum value is `28800`. The minimum value is `0`, default is `600`.
- `client_ip_pool` - (Required, String) The VPN client IPv4 address pool, expressed in CIDR format. The request must not overlap with any existing address prefixes in the VPC or any of the following reserved address ranges:  - `127.0.0.0/8` (IPv4 loopback addresses)  - `161.26.0.0/16` (IBM services)  - `166.8.0.0/14` (Cloud Service Endpoints)  - `169.254.0.0/16` (IPv4 link-local addresses)  - `224.0.0.0/4` (IPv4 multicast addresses)The prefix length of the client IP address pool's CIDR must be between`/9` (8,388,608 addresses) and `/22` (1024 addresses). A CIDR block that contains twice the number of IP addresses that are required to enable the maximum number of concurrent connections is recommended.
