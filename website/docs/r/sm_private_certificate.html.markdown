# ibm_sm_private_certificate

Provides a resource for PrivateCertificate. This allows PrivateCertificate to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_sm_private_certificate" "sm_private_certificate"{
  instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region        = "us-south"
  name 			= "secret-name"
  certificate_template = "cert-template-1"
  custom_metadata = {"key":"value"}
  description = "Extended description for this secret."
  common_name = "example.com"
  labels = ["my-label"]
  rotation {
		auto_rotate = true
		interval = 1
		unit = "day"
  }
  secret_group_id = "default"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  - Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  - Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For iaas_classic_username
  - Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  - Click on user.
  - Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab

For more informaton, see [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs#authentication).
