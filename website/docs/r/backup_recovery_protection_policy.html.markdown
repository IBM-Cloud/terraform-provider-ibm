## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

* `backup_policy` - (Required, List) Specifies the backup schedule and retentions of a Protection Policy.
Nested schema for **backup_policy**:
	* `bmr` - (Optional, List) Specifies the BMR schedule in case of physical source protection.
	Nested schema for **bmr**:
		* `retention` - (Required, List) Specifies the retention of a backup.
		Nested schema for **retention**:
			* `data_lock_config` - (Optional, List) Specifies WORM retention type for the snapshots. When a WORM retention type is specified, the snapshots of the Protection Groups using this policy will be kept for the last N days as specified in the duration of the datalock. During that time, the snapshots cannot be deleted.
			Nested schema for **data_lock_config**:
				* `duration` - (Required, Integer) Specifies the duration for a dataLock. <br> Example. If duration is 7 and unit is Months, the dataLock is enabled for last 7 * 30 = 210 days of the backup.
				  * Constraints: The minimum value is `1`.
				* `enable_worm_on_external_target` - (Optional, Boolean) Specifies whether objects in the external target associated with this policy need to be made immutable.
				* `mode` - (Required, String) Specifies the type of WORM retention type. 'Compliance' implies WORM retention is set for compliance reason. 'Administrative' implies WORM retention is set for administrative purposes.
				  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Compliance`, `Administrative`.
				* `unit` - (Required, String) Specificies the Retention Unit of a dataLock measured in days, months or years. <br> If unit is 'Months', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 30. <br> Example: If duration is 4 and unit is 'Months' then number of retention days will be 30 * 4 = 120 days. <br> If unit is 'Years', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 365. <br> If duration is 2 and unit is 'Months' then number of retention days will be 365 * 2 = 730 days.
				  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Days`, `Weeks`, `Months`, `Years`.
			* `duration` - (Required, Integer) Specifies the duration for a backup retention. <br> Example. If duration is 7 and unit is Months, the retention of a backup is 7 * 30 = 210 days.
			  * Constraints: The minimum value is `1`.
			* `unit` - (Required, String) Specificies the Retention Unit of a backup measured in days, months or years. <br> If unit is 'Months', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 30. <br> Example: If duration is 4 and unit is 'Months' then number of retention days will be 30 * 4 = 120 days. <br> If unit is 'Years', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 365. <br> If duration is 2 and unit is 'Years' then number of retention days will be 365 * 2 = 730 days.
			  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Days`, `Weeks`, `Months`, `Years`.
		* `schedule` - (Required, List) Specifies settings that defines how frequent bmr backup will be performed for a Protection Group.
		Nested schema for **schedule**:
			* `day_schedule` - (Optional, List) Specifies settings that define a schedule for a Protection Group runs to start after certain number of days.
			Nested schema for **day_schedule**:
				* `frequency` - (Required, Integer) Specifies a factor to multiply the unit by, to determine the backup schedule. <br> Example: If 'frequency' set to 2 and the unit is 'Hours', then Snapshots are backed up every 2 hours. <br> This field is only applicable if unit is 'Minutes', 'Hours' or 'Days'.
				  * Constraints: The minimum value is `1`.
			* `month_schedule` - (Optional, List) Specifies settings that define a schedule for a Protection Group runs to on specific week and specific days of that week.
			Nested schema for **month_schedule**:
				* `day_of_month` - (Optional, Integer) Specifies the exact date of the month (such as 18) in a Monthly Schedule specified by unit field as 'Years'. <br> Example: if 'dayOfMonth' is set to '18', a backup is performed on the 18th of every month.
				* `day_of_week` - (Optional, List) Specifies a list of days of the week when to start Protection Group Runs. <br> Example: To run a Protection Group on every Monday and Tuesday, set the schedule with following values: <br>  unit: 'Weeks' <br>  dayOfWeek: ['Monday','Tuesday'].
				  * Constraints: Allowable list items are: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`.
				* `week_of_month` - (Optional, String) Specifies the week of the month (such as 'Third') or nth day of month (such as 'First' or 'Last') in a Monthly Schedule specified by unit field as 'Months'. <br>This field can be used in combination with 'dayOfWeek' to define the day in the month to start the Protection Group Run. <br> Example: if 'weekOfMonth' is set to 'Third' and day is set to 'Monday', a backup is performed on the third Monday of every month. <br> Example: if 'weekOfMonth' is set to 'Last' and dayOfWeek is not set, a backup is performed on the last day of every month.
				  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `First`, `Second`, `Third`, `Fourth`, `Last`.
			* `unit` - (Required, String) Specifies how often to start new runs of a Protection Group. <br>'Weeks' specifies that new Protection Group runs start weekly on certain days specified using 'dayOfWeek' field. <br>'Months' specifies that new Protection Group runs start monthly on certain day of specific week.
			  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Days`, `Weeks`, `Months`, `Years`.
			* `week_schedule` - (Optional, List) Specifies settings that define a schedule for a Protection Group runs to start on certain days of week.
			Nested schema for **week_schedule**:
				* `day_of_week` - (Required, List) Specifies a list of days of the week when to start Protection Group Runs. <br> Example: To run a Protection Group on every Monday and Tuesday, set the schedule with following values: <br>  unit: 'Weeks' <br>  dayOfWeek: ['Monday','Tuesday'].

* `id` - The unique identifier of the backup_recovery_protection_policy.
* `is_replicated` - (Boolean) This field is set to true when policy is the replicated policy.
* `policy_id` - The unique identifier of the policy ID.
* `is_usable` - (Boolean) This field is set to true if the linked policy which is internally created from a policy templates qualifies as usable to create more policies on the cluster.

## Import

You can import the `ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy` resource by using `id`. The ID is formed using tenantID and resourceId.
`id = <tenantId>::<policy_id>`. 


#### Syntax
```
import {
	to = <ibm_backup_recovery_resource>
	id = "<tenantId>::<policy_id>"
}
```

#### Example
```
resource "ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy" "terra_policy_1" {
    x_ibm_tenant_id = "jhxqx715r9/"
    name = "test-terra-policy-2"
