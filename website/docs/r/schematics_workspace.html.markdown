Nested scheme for **runtime_data**:
	* `engine_cmd` - (Optional, String) The command that was used to apply the Terraform template or IBM Cloud catalog software template.
	* `engine_name` - (Optional, String) The provisioning engine that was used to apply the Terraform template or IBM Cloud catalog software template.
	* `engine_version` - (Optional, String) The version of the provisioning engine that was used.
	* `id` - (Optional, String) The ID that was assigned to your Terraform template or IBM Cloud catalog software template.
	* `log_store_url` - (Optional, String) The URL to access the logs that were created during the creation, update, or deletion of your IBM Cloud resources.

	* `resources` - (Optional, List) List of resources.
	* `state_store_url` - (Optional, String) The URL where the Terraform statefile (`terraform.tfstate`) is stored. You can use the statefile to find an overview of IBM Cloud resources that were created by Schematics. Schematics uses the statefile as an inventory list to determine future create, update, or deletion jobs.
* `status` - (String) The status of the workspace.   **Active**: After you successfully ran your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the state of your workspace changes to `Active`.   **Connecting**: Schematics tries to connect to the template in your source repo. If successfully connected, the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input parameters, is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of the workspace changes to `Scanning`.   **Draft**: The workspace is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab repository.   **Failed**: If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure code in IBM Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to `Failed`.   **Inactive**: The Terraform template was scanned successfully and the workspace creation is complete. You can now start running Schematics plan and apply jobs to provision the IBM Cloud resources that you specified in your template. If you have an `Active` workspace and decide to remove all your resources, your workspace is set to `Inactive` after all your resources are removed.   **In progress**: When you instruct IBM Cloud Schematics to run your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes to `In progress`.   **Scanning**: The download of the Terraform template is complete and vulnerability scanning started. If the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to `Inactive`. If errors in your template are found, the state changes to `Template Error`.   **Stopped**: The Schematics plan, apply, or destroy job was cancelled manually.   **Template Error**: The Schematics template contains errors and cannot be processed.
* `updated_at` - (String) The timestamp when the workspace was last updated.
* `updated_by` - (String) The user ID that updated the workspace.
* `status_code` - (String) The success or error code that was returned for the last plan, apply, or destroy job that ran against your workspace.
* `status_msg` - (String) The success or error message that was returned for the last plan, apply, or destroy job that ran against your workspace.

## Import

You can import the `ibm_schematics_workspace` resource by using `id`. The unique identifier of the workspace.

# Syntax
```
$ terraform import ibm_schematics_workspace.schematics_workspace <id>
```
**Note**

This resource can perform create, read, update and delete operations of schematics workspace. Other schematics operations such as `Plan` and `Apply` which are available in IBM Cloud Schematics console are currently not supported.
