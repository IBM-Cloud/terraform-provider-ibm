# ibm_is_volume
Create, update, or delete a VPC block storage volume. For more information, about the VPC block storage volume, see [getting started with VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc).

~> **NOTE:**
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
The following example creates a volume with 10 IOPs tier.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_volume" "example" {
  name    = "example-volume"
  profile = "10iops-tier"
  zone    = "us-south-1"
}
```
The following example creates a custom volume.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_volume" "example" {
  name           = "example-volume"
  profile        = "custom"
  zone           = "us-south-1"
  iops           = 1000
  capacity       = 200
  encryption_key = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/dffc98a0f1f0f95f6613b3b752286b87:e4a29d1a-2ef0-42a6-8fd2-350deb1c647e:key:5437653b-c4b1-447f-9646-b2a2a4cd6179"
}

```

## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_volume` resource provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for creating instance.
- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for deleting instance.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `capacity` - (Optional, Integer) (The capacity of the volume in gigabytes. This defaults to `100`, minimum to `10 ` and maximum to `16000`.

  ~> **NOTE:** Supports only expansion on update (must be attached to a running instance and must not be less than the current volume capacity). Can be updated only if volume is attached to an running virtual server instance. Stopped instance will be started on update of capacity of the volume.

- `bandwidth` - (Integer) The maximum bandwidth (in megabits per second) for the volume
- `delete_all_snapshots` - (Optional, Bool) Deletes all snapshots created from this volume.
- `encryption_key` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The key to use for encrypting this volume.
- `iops` - (Optional, Integer) The total input/ output operations per second (IOPS) for your storage. This value is required for `custom` storage profiles only.

  ~> **NOTE:** `iops` value can be upgraded and downgraged if volume is attached to an running virtual server instance. Stopped instances will be started on update of volume.

  This table shows how storage size affects the `iops` ranges:

            |   Size range (GB)  |   IOPS range   |
            |--------------------|----------------|
            |    10  -     39    |  100  -   1000 |
            |    40  -     79    |  100  -   2000 |
            |    80  -     99    |  100  -   4000 |
            |   100  -    499    |  100  -   6000 |
            |   500  -    999    |  100  -  10000 |
            |  1000  -   1999    |  100  -  20000 |
            |  2000  -   3999    |  100  -  40000 |
            |  4000  -   1999    |  100  -  40000 |
            |  8000  -   1999    |  100  -  48000 |
            | 10000  -  16000    |  100  -  48000 |

- `name` - (Required, String) The user-defined name for this volume.No.
- `profile` - (Required, String) The profile to use for this volume.

  ~> **NOTE:**  tiered profiles [`general-purpose`, `5iops-tier`, `10iops-tier`] can be upgraded and downgraded into each other if volume is attached to an running virtual server instance. Stopped instances will be started on update of volume.
- `resource_group` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The resource group ID for this volume.
- `resource_controller_url` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The URL of the IBM Cloud dashboard that can be used to explore and view details about this instance.
- `tags`- (Optional, Array of Strings) A list of user tags that you want to add to your volume. (https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/tagging#types-of-tags)
- `zone` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The location of the volume.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `encryption_type` - (String) The type of encryption used in the volume [**provider_managed**, **user_managed**].
- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the volume.
- `source_snapshot` - ID of the snapshot, if volume was created from it.
- `status` - (String) The status of volume. Supported values are **available**, **failed**, **pending**, **unusable**, or **pending_deletion**.
- `status_reasons` - (List) Array of reasons for the current status.

  Nested scheme for `status_reasons`:
  - `code` - (String) A string with an underscore as a special character identifying the status reason.
  - `message` - (String) An explanation of the status reason.
  - `more_info` - (String) Link to documentation about this status reason
- `crn` - (String) The CRN for the volume.

## Import
The `ibm_is_volume` resource can be imported by using volume ID.
