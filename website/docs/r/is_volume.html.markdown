# ibm_is_volume
Create, update, or delete a VPC block storage volume. For more information, about the VPC block storage volume, see [getting started with VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc).

~> **NOTE:**
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
The following example creates a volume with 10 IOPs tier.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_volume" "example" {
  name    = "example-volume"
  profile = "10iops-tier"
  zone    = "us-south-1"
}
```
The following example creates a custom volume.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_volume" "example" {
  name           = "example-volume"
  profile        = "custom"
  zone           = "us-south-1"
  iops           = 1000
  capacity       = 200
  encryption_key = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/dffc98a0f1f0f95f6613b3b752286b87:e4a29d1a-2ef0-42a6-8fd2-350deb1c647e:key:5437653b-c4b1-447f-9646-b2a2a4cd6179"
}

```

The following example creates a volume from snapshot.
```terraform
resource "ibm_is_volume" "storage" {
  name            = "example-volume"
  profile         = "general-purpose"
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  source_snapshot = ibm_is_snapshot.example.id
}
```
## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_volume` resource provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for creating instance.
- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for deleting instance.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `access_tags`  - (Optional, List of Strings) A list of access management tags to attach to the bare metal server.

  ~> **Note:** 
  **&#x2022;** You can attach only those access tags that already exists.</br>
  **&#x2022;** For more information, about creating access tags, see [working with tags](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=ui#create-access-console).</br>
  **&#x2022;** You must have the access listed in the [Granting users access to tag resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access) for `access_tags`</br>
  **&#x2022;** `access_tags` must be in the format `key:value`.
- `capacity` - (Optional, Integer) (The capacity of the volume in gigabytes. This defaults to `100`, minimum to `10 ` and maximum to `16000`.

  ~> **NOTE:** Supports only expansion on update (must be attached to a running instance and must not be less than the current volume capacity). Can be updated only if volume is attached to an running virtual server instance. Stopped instance will be started on update of capacity of the volume.If `source_snapshot` is provided `capacity` must be at least the snapshot's minimum_capacity. The maximum value may increase in the future and If unspecified, the capacity will be the source snapshot's minimum_capacity.

- `bandwidth` - (Integer) The maximum bandwidth (in megabits per second) for the volume
- `delete_all_snapshots` - (Optional, Bool) Deletes all snapshots created from this volume.
- `encryption_key` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The key to use for encrypting this volume.
- `iops` - (Optional, Integer) The total input/ output operations per second (IOPS) for your storage. This value is required for `custom` storage profiles only.

  ~> **NOTE:** `iops` value can be upgraded and downgraged if volume is attached to an running virtual server instance. Stopped instances will be started on update of volume.

  This table shows how storage size affects the `iops` ranges:

            |   Size range (GB)  |   IOPS range   |
            |--------------------|----------------|
            |    10  -     39    |  100  -   1000 |
            |    40  -     79    |  100  -   2000 |
            |    80  -     99    |  100  -   4000 |
            |   100  -    499    |  100  -   6000 |
            |   500  -    999    |  100  -  10000 |
            |  1000  -   1999    |  100  -  20000 |
            |  2000  -   3999    |  100  -  40000 |
            |  4000  -   1999    |  100  -  40000 |
            |  8000  -   1999    |  100  -  48000 |
            | 10000  -  16000    |  100  -  48000 |
