# ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides
This resource can be used for management of keys and respective policies in both Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Service (HPCS). It allows standard and root keys to be created with policies. The region parameter in the `provider.tf` file must be set. If region parameter is not specified, `us-south` is used as default. If the region in the `provider.tf` file is different from the Key Protect instance, the instance cannot be retrieved by Terraform and the Terraform action fails.

After creating an Hyper Protect Crypto Service instance you need to initialize the instance properly with the crypto units, in order to create, or manage Hyper Protect Crypto Service keys. For more information, about how to initialize the Hyper Protect Crypto Service instance, see [Initialize Hyper Protect Crypto](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm) only for HPCS instance.


## Example usage to provision Key Protect service and KMS key with policy details

```terraform
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "kms_instance" {
  name     = "instance-name"
  service  = "kms"
  plan     = "tiered-pricing"
  location = "us-south"
}
resource "ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides" "test" {
  instance_id  = ibm_resource_instance.kms_instance.guid
  key_name     = "key-name"
  standard_key = false
  force_delete = true
  rotation {
    enabled = true
    interval_month = 5  
  }
  dual_auth_delete {
    enabled = false
  }
}
resource "ibm_cos_bucket" "smart-us-south" {
  bucket_name          = "atest-bucket"
  resource_instance_id = "cos-instance-id"
  region_location      = "us-south"
  storage_class        = "smart"
  kms_key_crn          = ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides.test.id
}
```
  **Note:**
  
 `key_protect` attribute to associate a kms_key with a COS bucket has been renamed as `kms_key_crn` , hence it is recommended to all the new users to use `kms_key_crn`.Although the support for older attribute name `key_protect` will be continued for existing customers.

## Example usage to provision HPCS service and KMS key with policy details

Below steps explains how to provision a HPCS service , intialize the service and and KMS key with policy details.

Step 1: Provision the service using `ibm_resource_instance`

```terraform
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "hpcs"{
  name = "hpcsservice"
  service = "hs-crypto"
  plan = "standard"
  location = "us-south"
  parameters = {
      units = 2
  }
}
```

Step 2: Initialize your service instance manually

To manage your keys, you need to initialize your service instance first. Two options are provided for initializing a service instance. You can use the IBM Hyper Protect Crypto Services Management Utilities to initialize a service instance by using master key parts stored on smart cards. This provides the highest level of security. You can also use the IBM Cloud Trusted Key Entry (TKE) command-line interface (CLI) plug-in to initialize your service instance. For more details refer [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-get-started#initialize-crypto)

Step 3: Manage your keys using `ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides`

```terraform
resource "ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides" "key" {
  instance_id  = ibm_resource_instance.hpcs.guid
  key_name     = var.key_name
  standard_key = false
  force_delete = true
}
```

## Example usage to provision KMS and import a key with policy details

```terraform
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "kp_instance" {
  name     = "test_kp"
  service  = "kms"
  plan     = "tiered-pricing"
  location = "us-south"
}
resource "ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides" "key" {
  instance_id = ibm_resource_instance.kp_instance.guid
  key_name       = "key"
  standard_key   = false
  payload = "aW1wb3J0ZWQucGF5bG9hZA=="
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource.

- `endpoint_type` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The type of the public or private endpoint to be used for creating keys.
- `encrypted_nonce` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The encrypted nonce value that verifies your request to import a key to Key Protect. This value must be encrypted by using the key that you want to import to the service. To retrieve a nonce, use the `ibmcloud kp import-token get` command. Then, encrypt the value by running `ibmcloud kp import-token encrypt-nonce`. Only for imported root key.
- `expiration_date` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String)  Expiry date of the key material. The date format follows with RFC 3339. You can set an expiration date on any key on its creation. A key moves into the deactivated state within one hour past its expiration date, if one is assigned. If you create a key without specifying an expiration date, the key does not expire. For example, `2018-12-01T23:20:50Z`.
- `force_delete` - (Optional, Bool) If set to **true**, Key Protect forces the deletion of a root or standard key, even if this key is still in use, such as to protect an IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket. Note that the key cannot be deleted if the protected cloud resource is set up with a retention policy. Successful deletion includes the removal of any registrations that are associated with the key. Default value is **false**. **Note** Before Terraform destroy if `force_delete` flag is introduced after provisioning keys, a Terraform apply must be done before Terraform destroy for `force_delete` flag to take effect.
- `instance_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The HPCS or key-protect instance ID.
- `iv_value` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String)  Used with import tokens. The initialization vector (IV) that is generated when you encrypt a nonce. The IV value is required to decrypt the encrypted nonce value that you provide when you make a key import request to the service. To generate an IV, encrypt the nonce by running `ibmcloud kp import-token encrypt-nonce`. Only for imported root key.
- `key_name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The name of the key.
- `key_ring_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the key ring where you want to add your Key Protect key. The default value is `default`.
- `payload` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The base64 encoded key that you want to store and manage in the service. To import an existing key, provide a 256-bit key. To generate a new key, omit this parameter.
- `standard_key`- (Optional, Bool) Set flag **true** for standard key, and **false** for root key. Default value is **false**.Yes.
- `rotation` -  (Optional, List) Specifies the key rotation time interval in months, with a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 12.
    Nested scheme for `rotation`:
    - `interval_month`- (Required, Integer) Specifies the key rotation time interval in months. CONSTRAINTS: 1 ≤ value ≤ 12 **Note** Rotation policy cannot be set for standard key and imported key. Once the rotation policy is set, it cannot be unset or removed by using Terraform.
    - `enabled`- (Required, Bool) If set to **true**, Key Protect enables a rotation policy on a single key.

- `dual_auth_delete` - (Required, List) Data associated with the dual authorization delete policy.
    Nested scheme for `dual_auth_delete`:
    - `enabled`- (Required, Bool) If set to **true**, Key Protect enables a dual authorization policy on a single key. **Note:** Once the dual authorization policy is set on the key, it cannot be reverted. A key with dual authorization policy enabled cannot be destroyed by using  Terraform.


## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `id` - (String) The CRN of the key.
- `crn` - (String) The CRN of the key.
- `status` - (String) The status of the key.
- `key_id` - (String) The ID of the key.
- `key_ring_id` - (String) The ID of the key ring that your Key Protect key belongs to.
- `type` - (String) The type of the key KMS or HPCS.
- `rotation` - (List) Data associated with the automatic key rotation policy.
    Nested scheme for `rotation`:
    - `interval_month` - (String) The key rotation time interval in months.
    - `enabled` - (Boolean) If set to true, Key Protect enables a rotation policy on a single key.

- `dual_auth_delete` - (List) Data associated with the dual authorization delete policy.
    Nested scheme for `dual_auth_delete`:
    - `enabled` - (Boolean) If set to **true**, Key Protect enables a dual authorization policy on the key.

## Import
The `ibm_kms_key_with_policy_overrides` can be imported by using the `id` and `crn`.
