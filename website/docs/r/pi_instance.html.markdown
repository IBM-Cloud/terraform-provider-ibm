# ibm_pi_instance
Create or update a [Power Systems Virtual Server instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-creating-power-virtual-server).

## Example usage
The following example creates a Power Systems Virtual Server instance. 

```terraform
resource "ibm_pi_instance" "test-instance" {
    pi_memory             = "4"
    pi_processors         = "2"
    pi_instance_name      = "test-vm"
    pi_proc_type          = "shared"
    pi_image_id           = "${data.ibm_pi_image.powerimages.id}"
    pi_key_pair_name      = ibm_pi_key.key.key_id
    pi_sys_type           = "s922"
    pi_cloud_instance_id  = "51e1879c-bcbe-4ee1-a008-49cdba0eaf60"
    pi_pin_policy         = "none"
    pi_health_status      = "WARNING"
    pi_network {
      network_id = data.ibm_pi_public_network.dsnetwork.id
    }
}
```

**Note**
* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  
  Example usage:
  
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```

## Timeouts

The `ibm_pi_instance` provides the following [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - The creation of the instance is considered failed if no response is received for 120 minutes.
- **Update** The updation of the instance is considered failed if no response is received for 60 minutes.
- **delete** - The deletion of the instance is considered failed if no response is received for 60 minutes.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `pi_affinity_instance` - (Optional, String) PVM Instance (ID or Name) to base storage affinity policy against; required if requesting `affinity` and `pi_affinity_volume` is not provided.
- `pi_affinity_policy` - (Optional, String) Affinity policy for pvm instance being created; ignored if `pi_storage_pool` provided; for policy affinity requires one of `pi_affinity_instance` or `pi_affinity_volume` to be specified; for policy anti-affinity requires one of `pi_anti_affinity_instances` or `pi_anti_affinity_volumes` to be specified; Allowable values: `affinity`, `anti-affinity`
- `pi_affinity_volume`- (Optional, String) Volume (ID or Name) to base storage affinity policy against; required if requesting `affinity` and `pi_affinity_instance` is not provided.
- `pi_anti_affinity_instances` - (Optional, String) List of pvmInstances to base storage anti-affinity policy against; required if requesting `anti-affinity` and `pi_anti_affinity_volumes` is not provided.
- `pi_anti_affinity_volumes`- (Optional, String) List of volumes to base storage anti-affinity policy against; required if requesting `anti-affinity` and `pi_anti_affinity_instances` is not provided.
- `pi_cloud_instance_id` - (Required, String) The GUID of the service instance associated with an account.
- `pi_deployment_type` - (Optional, String) Custom deployment type; Allowable value: `EPIC`.
- `pi_health_status` - (Optional, String) Specifies if Terraform should poll for the health status to be `OK` or `WARNING`. The default value is `OK`.
- `pi_image_id` - (Required, String) The ID of the image that you want to use for your Power Systems Virtual Server instance. The image determines the operating system that is installed in your instance. To list available images, run the `ibmcloud pi images` command.
- `pi_instance_name` - (Required, String) The name of the Power Systems Virtual Server instance. 
- `pi_key_pair_name` - (Optional, String) The name of the SSH key that you want to use to access your Power Systems Virtual Server instance. The SSH key must be uploaded to IBM Cloud.
- `pi_license_repository_capacity` - (Optional, Integer) The VTL license repository capacity TB value. Only use with VTL instances. `pi_memory >= 16 + (2 * pi_license_repository_capacity)`.
  - **Note**: Provisioning VTL instances is temporarily disabled.
- `pi_memory` - (Optional, Float) The amount of memory that you want to assign to your instance in gigabytes.
  - Required when not creating SAP instances. Conflicts with `pi_sap_profile_id`.
- `pi_migratable`- (Optional, Bool) Indicates the VM is migrated or not.
- `pi_network` - (Required, List of Map) List of one or more networks to attach to the instance.

  The `pi_network` block supports:
  - `network_id` - (String) The network ID to assign to the instance.
  - `ip_address` - (String) The ip address to be used of this network.
- `pi_pin_policy` - (Optional, String) Select the pinning policy for your Power Systems Virtual Server instance. Supported values are `soft`, `hard`, and `none`.    **Note** You can choose to soft pin (`soft`) or hard pin (`hard`) a virtual server to the physical host where it runs. When you soft pin an instance for high availability, the instance automatically migrates back to the original host once the host is back to its operating state. If the instance has a licensing restriction with the host, the hard pin option restricts the movement of the instance during remote restart, automated remote restart, DRO, and live partition migration. The default pinning policy is `none`. 
- `pi_placement_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the placement group that the instance is in or empty quotes `""` to indicate it is not in a placement group. The meta-argument `count` and a `pi_replicants` cannot be used when specifying a placement group ID. Instances provisioning in the same placement group must be provisioned one at a time; however, to provision multiple instances on the same host or different hosts then use `pi_replicants` and `pi_replication_policy` instead of `pi_placement_group_id`.
- `pi_processors` - (Optional, Float) The number of vCPUs to assign to the VM as visible within the guest Operating System.
  - Required when not creating SAP instances. Conflicts with `pi_sap_profile_id`.
- `pi_proc_type` - (Optional, String) The type of processor mode in which the VM will run with `shared`, `capped` or `dedicated`.
  - Required when not creating SAP instances. Conflicts with `pi_sap_profile_id`.
- `pi_replicants` - (Optional, Integer) The number of instances that you want to provision with the same configuration. If this parameter is not set,  `1` is used by default.
- `pi_replication_policy` - (Optional, String) The replication policy that you want to use, either `affinity`, `anti-affinity` or `none`. If this parameter is not set, `none` is used by default. 
- `pi_replication_scheme` - (Optional, String) The replication scheme that you want to set, either `prefix` or `suffix`.
- `pi_sap_profile_id` - (Optional, String) SAP Profile ID for the amount of cores and memory.
  - Required only when creating SAP instances.
- `pi_sap_deployment_type` - (Optional, String) Custom SAP deployment type information (For Internal Use Only).
- `pi_shared_processor_pool` - (Optional, String) The shared processor pool for instance deployment. Conflicts with `pi_sap_profile_id`.
- `pi_storage_pool` - (Optional, String) Storage Pool for server deployment; if provided then `pi_affinity_policy` and `pi_storage_type` will be ignored.
- `pi_storage_pool_affinity` - (Optional, Bool) Indicates if all volumes attached to the server must reside in the same storage pool. The default value is `true`. To attach data volumes from a different storage pool (mixed storage) set to `false` and use `pi_volume_attach` resource. Once set to `false`, cannot be set back to `true` unless all volumes attached reside in the same storage type and pool.
- `pi_storage_type` - (Optional, String) - Storage type for server deployment. Only valid when you deploy one of the IBM supplied stock images. Storage type for a custom image (an imported image or an image that is created from a VM capture) defaults to the storage type the image was created in
