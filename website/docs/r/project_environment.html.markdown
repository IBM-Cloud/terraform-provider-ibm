## Import

You can import the `ibm_project_environment` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `project_id`, and `project_environment_id` in the following format:

<pre>
&lt;project_id&gt;/&lt;project_environment_id&gt;
</pre>
* `project_id`: A string. The unique project ID.
* `project_environment_id`: A string. The environment ID as a friendly name.

# Syntax
<pre>
$ terraform import ibm_project_environment.project_environment &lt;project_id&gt;/&lt;project_environment_id&gt;
</pre>
