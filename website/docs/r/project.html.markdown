# ibm_project

Provides a resource for project. This allows project to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_project" "project_instance" {
  description = "A microservice to deploy on top of ACME infrastructure."
  location = "us-south"
  name = "acme-microservice"
  resource_group = "Default"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

* `description` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) A project's descriptive text.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^$|^(?!\\s).*\\S$/`.
* `destroy_on_delete` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Boolean) The policy that indicates whether the resources are destroyed or not when a project is deleted.
  * Constraints: The default value is `true`.
* `location` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The location where the project's data and tools are created.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `12` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^$|^(us-south|us-east|eu-gb|eu-de)$/`.
* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The project name.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^(?!\\s)(?!.*\\s$)[^'"`<>{}\\x00-\\x1F]+$/`.
* `resource_group` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The resource group where the project's data and tools are created.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `40` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^$|^(?!\\s)(?!.*\\s$)[^'"`<>{}\\x00-\\x1F]*$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your resource is created.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the project.
* `metadata` - (List) The metadata of the project.
Nested scheme for **metadata**:
	* `created_at` - (String) A date and time value in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ, matching the date and time format as specified by RFC 3339.

	* `cumulative_needs_attention_view` - (List) The cumulative list of needs attention items for a project.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `10000` items. The minimum length is `0` items.
	Nested scheme for **cumulative_needs_attention_view**:
		* `config_id` - (String) The unique ID of a project.
		  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[\\.\\-0-9a-zA-Z]+$/`.
