# ibm_cos_backup_policy
Creates a backup policy on a given source bucket.


**Note:**

 The source bucket must have object versioning enabled.

 **Note:**

 Backup policies require a service-to-service IAM policy granting sync permissions from the source to the target bucket. Adding a `depends_on` for `ibm_iam_authorization_policy.policy` ensures that this policy is in place.

## Example usage


```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "cos_group" {
  name = "cos-resource-group"
}

resource "ibm_cos_bucket" "backup-source-bucket" {
  bucket_name           = "bucket-name"
  resource_instance_id  = "cos_instance_id"
  cross_region_location =  "us"
  storage_class          = "standard"
  object_versioning {
    enable  = true
  }

}


resource "ibm_cos_backup_vault" "backup-vault" {
  backup_vault_name           = "backup_vault_name"
  service_instance_id  = "cos_instance_id to create backup vault"
  region  = "us"
  activity_tracking_management_events = true
  metrics_monitoring_usage_metrics = true
  kms_key_crn = "crn:v1:staging:public:kms:us-south:a/997xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx54:5xxxxxxxa-fxxb-4xx8-9xx4-f1xxxxxxxxx5:key:af5667d5-dxx5-4xxf-8xxf-exxxxxxxf1d"

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 
- `bucket_crn` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) CRN of the source bucket.
- `initial_delete_after_days` - (Required, String) Number of days after which the data contained within the RecoveryRange will be deleted.

  **Note:**
Once set the value of `initial_delete_after_days` cannot be updated.

- `policy_name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) Name of the policy.
- `backup_type`- (Required, Forces new resource, String) Backup type. Currently only  `continuous` is supported.
- `target_backup_vault_crn` - (Required ,Forces new resource, String) CRN of the target backup vault.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `id` - (String) The ID of the backup policy.
