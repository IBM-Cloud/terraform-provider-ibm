# ibm_compute_bare_metal
Create, update, and delete a bare metal resource. This resource supports both monthly bare metal servers and hourly bare metal servers. For more detail on bare metal severs, refer to the [IBM Cloud bare metal server page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/bare-metal-servers).

## Example usage

### Example of an hourly bare metal server
When the `ibm_compute_bare_metal` resource definition has a `fixed_config_preset` attribute, Terraform creates an hourly bare metal server. Hardware specifications are predefined in the `fixed_config_preset` attribute and cannot be modified. The following example shows you how to create a new hourly bare metal server.

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_bare_metal" "hourly-bm1" {
  hostname             = "hourly-bm1"
  domain               = "example.com"
  os_reference_code    = "UBUNTU_16_64"
  datacenter           = "dal01"
  network_speed        = 100   # Optional
  hourly_billing       = true  # Optional
  private_network_only = false # Optional
  fixed_config_preset  = "S1270_8GB_2X1TBSATA_NORAID"

  user_metadata = "{\"value\":\"newvalue\"}" # Optional
  tags = [
    "collectd",
    "mesos-master",
  ]
  notes = "note test"
}
```

### Example of a monthly bare metal server
When the `fixed_config_preset` attribute is not configured, Terraform creates a monthly bare metal server resource. The monthly bare metal server resource provides options to configure process, memory, network, disk, and RAID. You can also can assign VLANs and subnets for the target monthly bare metal server. To configure the monthly bare metal server, you must provide additional attributes such as `package_key_name`, `proecss_key_name`, `disk_key_names`, and `os_key_name`. The following example shows you how to create a new monthly bare metal server.

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_bare_metal" "monthly_bm1" {
  # Mandatory fields
  package_key_name = "DUAL_E52600_V4_12_DRIVES"
  process_key_name = "INTEL_INTEL_XEON_E52620_V4_2_10"
  memory           = 64
  os_key_name      = "OS_WINDOWS_2012_R2_FULL_DC_64_BIT_2"
  hostname         = "cust-bm"
  domain           = "ms.com"
  datacenter       = "wdc04"
  network_speed    = 100
  public_bandwidth = 500
  disk_key_names   = ["HARD_DRIVE_800GB_SSD", "HARD_DRIVE_800GB_SSD", "HARD_DRIVE_800GB_SSD"]
  hourly_billing   = false

  # Optional fields
  private_network_only = false
  unbonded_network     = true
  user_metadata        = "{\"value\":\"newvalue\"}"
  public_vlan_id       = 12345678
  private_vlan_id      = 87654321
  public_subnet        = "50.97.46.160/28"
  private_subnet       = "10.56.109.128/26"
  tags = [
    "collectd",
    "mesos-master",
  ]
  redundant_power_supply = true
  storage_groups {
    # RAID 5
    array_type_id = 3

    # Use three disks
    hard_drives = [0, 1, 2]
    array_size  = 1600

    # Basic partition template for Windows
    partition_template_id = 17
  }
}

```

**Note**

Monthly bare metal servers do not support `immediate cancellation`. When Terraform deletes the monthly bare metal server, the `anniversary date cancellation` option is used.

### Example to create a bare metal server using quote ID based ordering
If you already have a quote ID for the bare metal server, you can create a new bare metal server with the quote ID. The following example shows you how to create a new bare metal server with a quote ID.


```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_bare_metal" "quote_test" {
  # Mandatory fields
  hostname = "quote-bm-test"
  domain   = "example.com"
  quote_id = 2209349

  # Optional fields
  user_metadata   = "{\"value\":\"newvalue\"}"
  public_vlan_id  = 12345678
  private_vlan_id = 87654321
  public_subnet   = "50.97.46.160/28"
  private_subnet  = "10.56.109.128/26"
  tags = [
    "collectd",
    "mesos-master",
  ]
}

```
