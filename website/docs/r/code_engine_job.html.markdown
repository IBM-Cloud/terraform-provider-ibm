# ibm_code_engine_job

Create, update, and delete code_engine_job with this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_code_engine_job" "code_engine_job_instance" {
  project_id      = ibm_code_engine_project.code_engine_project_instance.project_id
  name            = "my-job"
  image_reference = "icr.io/codeengine/helloworld"

  run_env_variables {
    type  = "literal"
    name  = "name"
    value = "value"
  }

  run_env_variables {
    type      = "secret_full_reference"

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

* `image_reference` - (Required, String) The name of the image that is used for this job. The format is `REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY:TAG` where `REGISTRY` and `TAG` are optional. If `REGISTRY` is not specified, the default is `docker.io`. If `TAG` is not specified, the default is `latest`. If the image reference points to a registry that requires authentication, make sure to also specify the property `image_secret`.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `256` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-_.]+[a-z0-9][\/])?([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-_]+[a-z0-9][\/])?[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-_.\/]+[a-z0-9](:[\\w][\\w.\\-]{0,127})?(@sha256:[a-fA-F0-9]{64})?$/`.
* `image_secret` - (Optional, String) The name of the image registry access secret. The image registry access secret is used to authenticate with a private registry when you download the container image. If the image reference points to a registry that requires authentication, the job / job runs will be created but submitted job runs will fail, until this property is provided, too. This property must not be set on a job run, which references a job template.
