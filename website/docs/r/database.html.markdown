# ibm_database

Create, update, or delete a IBM Cloud Database (ICD) instance. The `ibmcloud_api_key` that are used by  Terraform should grant IAM rights to create and modify IBM Cloud Databases and have access to the resource group the ICD instance is associated with. For more information, see [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql/reference-access-management.html#identity-and-access-management) to manage ICD instances.

If `resource_group_id` is not specified, the ICD instance is created in the default resource group. The `API_KEY` must be assigned permissions for this group.

Configuration of an ICD resource requires that the `region` parameter is set for the IBM provider in the `provider.tf` to be the same as the target ICD `location/region`. If not specified it default to `us-south`. A `terraform apply`  fails if the ICD `location` is set differently. If the Terraform configuration needs to deploy resources into multiple regions, provider alias can be used. For more information, see [Terraform provider configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#multiple-provider-instances).


## Example usage
To find an example for configuring a virtual server instance that connects to a PostgreSQL database, see [here](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/ibm-database).

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "<your_group>"
}

resource "ibm_database" "<your_database>" {
  name              = "<your_database_name>"
  plan              = "standard"
  location          = "eu-gb"
  service           = "databases-for-etcd"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]

  adminpassword                = "password12345678"

  group {
    group_id = "member"

    memory {
      allocation_mb = 14336
    }

    disk {
      allocation_mb = 20480
    }

    cpu {
      allocation_count = 3
    }
  }

  users {
    name     = "user123"
    password = "password12345678"
    type     = "database"
  }

  allowlist {
    address     = "172.168.1.1/32"
    description = "desc"

## Timeouts
The following timeouts are defined for this resource.

* `Create` The creation of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 60 minutes.
* `Update` The update of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 20 minutes.
* `Delete` The deletion of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 10 minutes.

ICD create instance typically takes between 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Delete and update takes a minute. Provisioning time are unpredictable, if the apply fails due to a timeout, import the database resource once the create is completed.

- `logical_replication_slot` - (Optional, List of Objects) A list of logical replication slots that you want to create on the database. Multiple blocks are allowed. This is only available for `databases-for-postgresql`.

  Nested scheme for `logical_replication_slot`:
  - `name` - (Required, String) The name of the `logical_replication_slot`.
  - `database_name` - (Required, String) The name of the database on which you want to create the `logical_replication_slot`.

For more information, see [Point-in-time Recovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-pitr).
- `remote_leader_id` - (Optional, String) A CRN of the leader database to make the replica(read-only) deployment. The leader database is created by a database deployment with the same service ID. A read-only replica is set up to replicate all of your data from the leader deployment to the replica deployment by using asynchronous replication. Removing the `remote_leader_id` attribute from an existing read-only replica will promote the deployment to a standalone deployment. The deployment will restart and break its connection with the leader. This will disable all database users associated with this deployment. For more information, see [Configuring Read-only Replicas](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-read-only-replicas).
- `skip_initial_backup` - (Optional, Boolean) Should only be set when promoting a read-only replica. By setting this value to `true`, you skip the initial backup that would normally be taken upon promotion. Skipping the initial backup means that your replica becomes available more quickly, but there is no immediate backup available. The default is `false`. For more information, see [Configuring Read-only Replicas]
- `resource_group_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String)  The ID of the resource group where you want to create the instance. To retrieve this value, run `ibmcloud resource groups` or use the `ibm_resource_group` data source. If no value is provided, the `default` resource group is used.
- `service` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The type of Cloud Databases that you want to create. Only the following services are currently accepted: `databases-for-etcd`, `databases-for-postgresql`, `databases-for-redis`, `databases-for-elasticsearch`, `messages-for-rabbitmq`,`databases-for-mongodb`,`databases-for-mysql`, and `databases-for-enterprisedb`.

- `tags` (Optional, Array of Strings) A list of tags that you want to add to your instance.
- `version` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The version of the database to be provisioned. If omitted, the database is created with the most recent major and minor version.
- `deletion_protection` - (Optional, Boolean) If the DB instance should have deletion protection within terraform enabled. This is not a property of the resource and does not prevent deletion outside of terraform. The database can't be deleted by terraform when this value is set to `true`. The default is `false`.
- `users` - (Optional, List of Objects) A list of users that you want to create on the database. Multiple blocks are allowed.

  Nested scheme for `users`:
  - `name` - (Required, String) The user name to add to the database instance. The user name must be in the range 5 - 32 characters.
  - `password` - (Required, String) The password for the user. Passwords must be between 15 and 32 characters in length and contain a letter and a number. Users with an `ops_manager` user type must have a password containing a special character `~!@#$%^&*()=+[]{}|;:,.<>/?_-` as well as a letter and a number. Other user types may only use special characters `-_`.
  - `type` - (Optional, String) The type for the user. Examples: `database`, `ops_manager`, `read_only_replica`. The default value is `database`.
  - `role` - (Optional, String) The role for the user. Only available for `ops_manager` user type or Redis 6.0 and above. Example roles for `ops_manager`: `group_read_only`, `group_data_access_admin`. For, Redis 6.0 and above, `role` must be in Redis ACL syntax for adding and removing command categories i.e. `+@category` or  `-@category`. Allowed command categories are `all`, `admin`, `read`, `write`. Example Redis `role`: `-@all +@read`

- `allowlist` - (Optional, List of Objects) A list of allowed IP addresses for the database. Multiple blocks are allowed.

  Nested scheme for `allowlist`:
  - `address` - (Optional, String) The IP address or range of database client addresses to be allowlisted in CIDR format. Example, `172.168.1.2/32`.
  - `description` - (Optional, String) A description for the allowed IP addresses range.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument references list, you can access the following attribute references after your resource is created.

- `adminuser` - (String) The user ID of the database administrator. Example, `admin` or `root`.
- `configuration_schema` (String) Database Configuration Schema in JSON format.
- `id` - (String) The CRN of the database instance.
- `status` - (String) The status of the instance.
- `version` - (String) The database version.

## Import
The database instance can be imported by using the ID, that is formed from the CRN. To import the resource, you must specify the `region` parameter in the `provider` block of your  Terraform configuration file. If the region is not specified, `us-south` is used by default. An  Terraform refresh or apply fails, if the database instance is not in the same region as configured in the provider or its alias.

CRN is a 120 digit character string of the form -  `crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-postgresql:us-south:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:79226bd4-4076-4873-b5ce-b1dba48ff8c4::`

**Syntax**

```
$ terraform import ibm_database.my_db <crn>
```

**Example**

```
$ terraform import ibm_database.my_db crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-postgresql:us-south:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:79226bd4-4076-4873-b5ce-b1dba48ff8c4::
```

Import requires a minimal Terraform config file to allow importing.

```terraform
resource "ibm_database" "<your_database>" {
  name              = "<your_database_name>"
}
```

Run `terraform state show ibm_database.<your_database>` after import to retrieve the more values to be included in the resource config file. Observe the ICD exports the admin userid. It does not export any more user IDs and passwords that are configured on the instance. These values must be retrieved from an alternative source. If new passwords need to be configured or the connection string that is retrieved to use the service, a new users block must be defined to create new users. This limitation is due to a lack of ICD functionality.
