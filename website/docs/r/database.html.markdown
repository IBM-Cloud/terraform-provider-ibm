# ibm_database

Create, update, or delete a IBM Cloud Database (ICD) instance. The `ibmcloud_api_key` that are used by  Terraform should grant IAM rights to create and modify IBM Cloud Databases and have access to the resource group the ICD instance is associated with. For more information, see [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql/reference-access-management.html#identity-and-access-management) to manage ICD instances.  

If `resource_group_id` is not specified, the ICD instance is created in the default resource group. The `API_KEY` must be assigned permissions for this group.  

Configuration of an ICD resource requires that the `region` parameter is set for the IBM provider in the `provider.tf` to be the same as the target ICD `location/region`. If not specified it default to `us-south`. A `terraform apply`  fails if the ICD `location` is set differently. If the Terraform configuration needs to deploy resources into multiple regions, provider alias can be used. For more information, see [Terraform provider configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#multiple-provider-instances).


## Example usage
To find an example for configuring a virtual server instance that connects to a PostgreSQL database, see [here](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/ibm-database).

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "<your_group>"
}

resource "ibm_database" "<your_database>" {
  name              = "<your_database_name>"
  plan              = "standard"
  location          = "eu-gb"
  service           = "databases-for-etcd"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]

  adminpassword                = "password12"
  members_memory_allocation_mb = 3072
  members_disk_allocation_mb   = 61440
  users {
    name     = "user123"
    password = "password12"
  }
  whitelist {
    address     = "172.168.1.1/32"
    description = "desc"
  }
}

output "ICD Etcd database connection string" {
  value = "http://${ibm_database.test_acc.connectionstrings[0].composed}"
}

```

### Sample database instance by using `node_` attributes
An example to configure and deploy database by using `node_` attributes instead of `memory_`.

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "<your_group>"
}

resource "ibm_database" "<your_database>" {
  name              = "<your_database_name>"
  plan              = "standard"
  location          = "eu-gb"
  service           = "databases-for-etcd"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]

  adminpassword                = "password12"
  node_count                = 3
  node_memory_allocation_mb = 1024
  node_disk_allocation_mb   = 20480
  users {
    name     = "user123"
    password = "password12"
  }
  whitelist {
    address     = "172.168.1.1/32"
    description = "desc"
  }
}

output "ICD Etcd database connection string" {
  value = "http://${ibm_database.test_acc.connectionstrings[0].composed}"
}

```

  resource_group_id                    = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  name                                 = "<your_database_name>"

## Timeouts
The following timeouts are defined for this resource. 

* `Create` The creation of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 60 minutes.
* `Update` The update of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 20 minutes.
* `Delete` The deletion of an instance is considered failed when no response is received for 10 minutes.

ICD create instance typically takes between 30 minutes to 45 minutes. Delete and update takes a minute. Provisioning time are unpredictable, if the apply fails due to a timeout, import the database resource once the create is completed.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument references list, you can access the following attribute references after your resource is created. 

- `adminuser` - (String) The user ID of the database administrator. Example, `admin` or `root`.
- `connectionstrings` - (Array) A list of connection strings for the database for each user ID. For more information, about how to use connection strings, see the [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-connection-strings). The results are returned in pairs of the userid and string: `connectionstrings.1.name = admin connectionstrings.1.string = postgres://admin:$PASSWORD@79226bd4-4076-4873-b5ce-b1dba48ff8c4.b8a5e798d2d04f2e860e54e5d042c915.databases.appdomain.cloud:32554/ibmclouddb?sslmode=verify-full` Individual string parameters can be retrieved by using  Terraform variables and outputs `connectionstrings.x.hosts.x.port` and `connectionstrings.x.hosts.x.host`.
- `id` - (String) The CRN of the database instance.
- `status` - (String) The status of the instance.
- `version` - (String) The database version.

## Import
The database instance can be imported by using the ID, that is formed from the CRN. To import the resource, you must specify the `region` parameter in the `provider` block of your  Terraform configuration file. If the region is not specified, `us-south` is used by default. An  Terraform refresh or apply fails, if the database instance is not in the same region as configured in the provider or its alias.

CRN is a 120 digit character string of the form -  `crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-postgresql:us-south:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:79226bd4-4076-4873-b5ce-b1dba48ff8c4::`

**Syntax**

```
$ terraform import ibm_database.my_db <crn>
```

**Example**

```
$ terraform import ibm_database.my_db crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-postgresql:us-south:a/4ea1882a2d3401ed1e459979941966ea:79226bd4-4076-4873-b5ce-b1dba48ff8c4::
```

Import requires a minimal Terraform config file to allow importing.

```terraform
resource "ibm_database" "<your_database>" {
  name              = "<your_database_name>"
```

Run `terraform state show ibm_database.<your_database>` after import to retrieve the more values to be included in the resource config file. Observe the ICD exports the admin userid. It does not export any more user IDs and passwords that are configured on the instance. These values must be retrieved from an alternative source. If new passwords need to be configured or the connection string that is retrieved to use the service, a new users block must be defined to create new users. This limitation is due to a lack of ICD functionality.
