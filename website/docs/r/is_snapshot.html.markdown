# ibm_is_snapshot

Create, update, or delete a snapshot. For more information, about subnet, see [creating snapshots](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-create).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name                     = "example-subnet"
  vpc                      = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone                     = "us-south-2"
  total_ipv4_address_count = 16
}

resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "example" {
  name       = "example-ssh"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCKVmnMOlHKcZK8tpt3MP1lqOLAcqcJzhsvJcjscgVERRN7/9484SOBJ3HSKxxNG5JN8owAjy5f9yYwcUg+JaUVuytn5Pv3aeYROHGGg+5G346xaq3DAwX6Y5ykr2fvjObgncQBnuU5KHWCECO/4h8uWuwh/kfniXPVjFToc+gnkqA+3RKpAecZhFXwfalQ9mMuYGFxn+fwn8cYEApsJbsEmb0iJwPiZ5hjFC8wREuiTlhPHDgkBLOiycd20op2nXzDbHfCHInquEe/gYxEitALONxm0swBOwJZwlTDOB7C6y2dzlrtxr1L59m7pCkWI4EtTRLvleehBoj3u7jB4usR"
}

resource "ibm_is_instance" "example" {
  name    = "example-vsi"
  image   = ibm_is_image.example.id
  profile = "bx2-2x8"
  primary_network_interface {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  }
  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone = "us-south-2"
  keys = [ibm_is_ssh_key.example.id]
  network_interfaces {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    name   = "eth1"
  }
}
resource "ibm_is_snapshot" "example" {
  name          = "example-snapshot"
  source_volume = ibm_is_instance.example.volume_attachments[0].volume_id

  //User can configure timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```

## Example usage (clones)
```
resource "ibm_is_snapshot" "example_clones" {
  name            = "example-snapshot"
  source_volume   = ibm_is_instance.example.volume_attachments[0].volume_id
  clones          = ["us-south-1", "us-south-2"]
  //User can configure timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}  
 ``` 

## Example usage (Source snasphot - cross region snapshot crn)
```terraform
resource "ibm_is_snapshot" "example_copy" {
  name                = "example-snapshot"
  source_snapshot_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:is:us-south:a/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx::snapshot:r006-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx"
}  
 ``` 

## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_snapshot` resource provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for creating Snapshot.
- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for deleting Snapshot.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `access_tags`  - (Optional, List of Strings) A list of access management tags to attach to the bare metal server.

  ~> **Note:** 
  **&#x2022;** You can attach only those access tags that already exists.</br>

  **&#x2022;** You must have the access listed in the [Granting users access to tag resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access) for `access_tags`</br>
  **&#x2022;** `access_tags` must be in the format `key:value`.
- `clones` - (Optional, List) The list of zones to create a clone of this snapshot.
