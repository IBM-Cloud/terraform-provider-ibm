# ibm\_is_share

Provides a resource for Share. This allows Share to be created, updated and deleted.


~> **NOTE**
IBM CloudÂ® File Storage for VPC is available for customers with special approval. Contact your IBM Sales representative if you are interested in getting access.

~> **NOTE**
This is a Beta feature and it is subject to change in the GA release 


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "my-share"
  size    = 200
  profile = "tier-3iops"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
}
```
## Example Usage (Create a replica share)

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example-1" {
  zone                  = "us-south-3"
  source_share          = ibm_is_share.example.id
  name                  = "my-replica1"
  profile               = "tier-3iops"
  replication_cron_spec = "0 */5 * * *"
}
```
## Example Usage (Create a file share with inline replica share)

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example-2" {
  zone    = "us-south-1"
  size    = 220
  name    = "my-share"
  profile = "tier-3iops"
  replica_share {
    name                  = "my-replica"
    replication_cron_spec = "0 */5 * * *"
    profile               = "tier-3iops"
    zone                  = "us-south-3"
  }
}
```
