# ibm_pi_cloud_connection

Create, update, or delete for a Power Systems Virtual Server cloud connection. For more information, about IBM power virtual server cloud, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example usage

The following example enables you to create a cloud connection:

```terraform
resource "ibm_pi_cloud_connection" "cloud_connection" {
  pi_cloud_instance_id		= "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
  pi_cloud_connection_name	= "test_cloud_connection"
  pi_cloud_connection_speed	= 50
}
```

**Note**

- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:

  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`

  Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
