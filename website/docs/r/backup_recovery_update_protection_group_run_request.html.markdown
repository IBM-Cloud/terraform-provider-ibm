# ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request

Create Update Protection Group Run Request Body.s with this resource.

**Note**
ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request resource does not support update or delete operations due to the absence of corresponding API endpoints. As a result, Terraform cannot manage these operations for those resources. Users should be aware that removing these resources from the configuration (main.tf) will only remove them from the Terraform state and will not affect the actual resources in the backend. Similarly updating these resources will throw an error in the plan phase stating that the resource cannot be updated.

**Important:** When managing resources that lack complete CRUD operations, users should exercise caution and consider the limitations described above. Manual intervention may be required to manage these resources in the backend if updates or deletions are necessary.**

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request" "backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request_instance" {
  group_id = "123:11:1"

		run_id = "run_id"
		local_snapshot_config {
			enable_legal_hold = true
			delete_snapshot = true

			* `copy_only_fully_successful` - (Optional, Boolean) Specifies if Snapshots are copied from a fully successful Protection Group Run or a partially successful Protection Group Run. If false, Snapshots are copied the Protection Group Run, even if the Run was not fully successful i.e. Snapshots were not captured for all Objects in the Protection Group. If true, Snapshots are copied only when the run is fully successful.
			* `id` - (Required, Integer) Specifies the Archival target to copy the Snapshots to.
			* `retention` - (Optional, List) Specifies the retention of a backup.
			Nested schema for **retention**:
				* `data_lock_config` - (Optional, List) Specifies WORM retention type for the snapshots. When a WORM retention type is specified, the snapshots of the Protection Groups using this policy will be kept for the last N days as specified in the duration of the datalock. During that time, the snapshots cannot be deleted.
				Nested schema for **data_lock_config**:
					* `duration` - (Required, Integer) Specifies the duration for a dataLock. <br> Example. If duration is 7 and unit is Months, the dataLock is enabled for last 7 * 30 = 210 days of the backup.

					* `enable_worm_on_external_target` - (Optional, Boolean) Specifies whether objects in the external target associated with this policy need to be made immutable.
					* `mode` - (Required, String) Specifies the type of WORM retention type. 'Compliance' implies WORM retention is set for compliance reason. 'Administrative' implies WORM retention is set for administrative purposes.
					  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Compliance`, `Administrative`.
					* `unit` - (Required, String) Specificies the Retention Unit of a dataLock measured in days, months or years. <br> If unit is 'Months', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 30. <br> Example: If duration is 4 and unit is 'Months' then number of retention days will be 30 * 4 = 120 days. <br> If unit is 'Years', then number specified in duration is multiplied to 365. <br> If duration is 2 and unit is 'Months' then number of retention days will be 365 * 2 = 730 days.
					  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `Days`, `Weeks`, `Months`, `Years`.
