# ibm_hpcs_managed_key

Provides a resource for managed_key. This allows managed_key to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_hpcs_managed_key" "managed_key_instance" {
  instance_id = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.instance_id
  region      = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.region
  uko_vault   = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.vault_id
  vault {
    id = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.vault_id
  }
  label         = "terraformKey"
  description   = "example key"
  template_name = ibm_hpcs_key_template.key_template_instance.name
}
```
