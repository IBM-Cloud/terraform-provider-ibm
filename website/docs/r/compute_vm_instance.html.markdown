# ibm_compute_vm_instance
Create, update, and delete a Virtual Machine (VM) instance. For more information, about IBM Cloud Virtual Machine instance, see [migrating VMDK or VHD images to VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-migrating-images-vpc).

**Note**

- For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API docs](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest).
- Update is not supported when the `bulk_vms` parameter is used.

## Example usage
In the following example, you can create a VM instance using a Debian image:

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "twc_terraform_sample" {
  hostname                   = "twc-terraform-sample-name"
  domain                     = "bar.example.com"
  os_reference_code          = "DEBIAN_8_64"
  datacenter                 = "wdc01"
  network_speed              = 10
  hourly_billing             = true
  private_network_only       = false
  cores                      = 1
  memory                     = 1024
  disks                      = [25, 10, 20]
  user_metadata              = "{\"value\":\"newvalue\"}"
  dedicated_acct_host_only   = true
  local_disk                 = false
  public_vlan_id             = 1391277
  private_vlan_id            = 7721931
  private_security_group_ids = [576973]
}
```

### In the following example, you can create a VM instance using a block device template:

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "terraform-sample-BDTGroup" {
  hostname   = "terraform-sample-blockDeviceTemplateGroup"
  domain     = "bar.example.com"
  datacenter = "ams01"

  //public_network_speed = 10
  hourly_billing = false
  cores          = 1
  memory         = 1024
  local_disk     = false
  image_id       = 12345
  tags = [
    "collectd",
    "mesos-master",
  ]
  public_subnet  = "50.97.46.160/28"
  private_subnet = "10.56.109.128/26"
}
```

### In the following example, you can create a VM instance using a flavor:

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "terraform-sample-flavor" {
  hostname             = "terraform-sample-flavor"
  domain               = "bar.example.com"
  os_reference_code    = "DEBIAN_8_64"
  datacenter           = "dal06"
  network_speed        = 10
  hourly_billing       = true
  local_disk           = false
  private_network_only = false
  flavor_key_name      = "B1_2X8X25"
  user_metadata        = "{\\\"value\\\":\\\"newvalue\\\"}"

  // provide disk 3, 4, 5 and so on
  disks = [10, 20, 30]
  tags  = ["collectd"]

  // It should be false
  dedicated_acct_host_only = false
  ipv6_enabled             = true
  secondary_ip_count       = 4
  notes                    = "VM notes"
}
```

### In the following example, you can create multiple vm's

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "terraform-bulk-vms" {
  bulk_vms {
    hostname = "vm1"

    domain = "bar.example.com"
  }
  bulk_vms {
    hostname = "vm2"

    domain = "bar.example.com"
  }

  os_reference_code    = "CENTOS_7_64"
  datacenter           = "dal09"
  network_speed        = 100
  hourly_billing       = true
  private_network_only = true
  cores                = 1
  memory               = 1024
  disks                = [25]
  local_disk           = false
}

```

### Example to create a VM instance by using a datacenter_choice. 
This example creates a VM instance by using a datacenter_choice. If VM fails to place order on first datacenter or vlans it retries to place order on subsequent datacenters and vlans untill place order is successful:

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "terraform-retry" {
  hostname          = "vmretry"
  domain            = "example.com"
  network_speed     = 100
  hourly_billing    = true
  cores             = 1
  memory            = 1024
  local_disk        = false
  os_reference_code = "DEBIAN_7_64"
  disks             = [25]

  datacenter_choice = [
    {
      datacenter      = "dal09"
      public_vlan_id  = 123245
      private_vlan_id = 123255
    },
    {
      datacenter = "wdc54"
    },
    {
      datacenter      = "dal09"
      public_vlan_id  = 153345
      private_vlan_id = 123255
    },
    {
      datacenter = "dal06"
    },
    {
      datacenter      = "dal09"
      public_vlan_id  = 123245
      private_vlan_id = 123255
    },
    {
      datacenter      = "dal09"
      public_vlan_id  = 1232454
      private_vlan_id = 1234567
    },
  ]

  //User can configure timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "20m"
    update = "20m"
    delete = "20m"
  }
}


```  

### Example of a quote based ordering

```terraform
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm1" {
  # Mandatory fields
  hostname             = "terraformquote"
  domain               = "IBM.cloud"
  quote_id             = "2877000"

  # Optional fields
  os_reference_code    = "DEBIAN_9_64"
  datacenter           = "dal06"
  network_speed        = 100
  hourly_billing       = false
  private_network_only = false
  flavor_key_name      = "B1_2X8X100"
  local_disk           = true
}

```

## Timeouts

The `ibm_is_instance` resource provides the following [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 90 minutes) Used to Wait for virtual guest creation.
- **update** - (Default 90 minutes) Used to Wait for upgrade transactions to finish.
- **delete** - (Default 90 minutes) Used to Wait for no active transactions.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `block_storage_ids`- (Optional, Array of Integers) File storage to which this computing instance has access. File storage must be in the same data center as the Bare Metal server. If you use this argument to authorize, access to file storage, then do not use the `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` argument in the `ibm_storage_block` resource in order to prevent the same storage be added twice.
