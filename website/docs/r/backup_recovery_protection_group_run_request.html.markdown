# ibm_backup_recovery_protection_group_run_request

Create backup_recovery_protection_group_run_requests with this resource.

**Note**
ibm_backup_recovery_protection_group_run_request resource does not support delete operation due to the absence of corresponding API endpoints. protection group run updates are managed through a separate resource `ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request`. 
Note that the `ibm_backup_recovery_protection_group_run_request` and `ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request` resources must be used in tandem to manage Protection Group Runs. There is no delete operation available for the protection group run resource. If  ibm_backup_recovery_update_protection_group_run_request or ibm_backup_recovery_protection_group_run_request resource is removed from the `main.tf` file, Terraform will remove it from the state file but not from the backend. The resource will continue to exist in the backend system.

**Important:** When managing resources that lack complete CRUD operations, users should exercise caution and consider the limitations described above. Manual intervention may be required to manage these resources in the backend if updates or deletions are necessary.**

## Example Usage

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

* `objects` - (Optional, Forces new resource, List) Specifies the list of objects to be protected by this Protection Group run. These can be leaf objects or non-leaf objects in the protection hierarchy. This must be specified only if a subset of objects from the Protection Groups needs to be protected.
Nested schema for **objects**:
	* `app_ids` - (Optional, List) Specifies a list of ids of applications.
	* `id` - (Required, Integer) Specifies the id of object.
	* `physical_params` - (Optional, List) Specifies physical parameters for this run.
	Nested schema for **physical_params**:
		* `metadata_file_path` - (Optional, String) Specifies metadata file path during run-now requests for physical file based backups for some specific source. If specified, it will override any default metadata/directive file path set at the object level for the source. Also note that if the job default does not specify a metadata/directive file path for the source, then specifying this field for that source during run-now request will be rejected.
* `run_type` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) Type of protection run. 'kRegular' indicates an incremental (CBT) backup. Incremental backups utilizing CBT (if supported) are captured of the target protection objects. The first run of a kRegular schedule captures all the blocks. 'kFull' indicates a full (no CBT) backup. A complete backup (all blocks) of the target protection objects are always captured and Change Block Tracking (CBT) is not utilized. 'kLog' indicates a Database Log backup. Capture the database transaction logs to allow rolling back to a specific point in time. 'kSystem' indicates system volume backup. It produces an image for bare metal recovery.
