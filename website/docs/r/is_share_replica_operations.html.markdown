Provides a resource for ShareTarget. This allows ShareTarget to be created, updated and deleted.

~> **NOTE**
IBM CloudÂ® File Storage for VPC is available for customers with special approval. Contact your IBM Sales representative if you are interested in getting access.

~> **NOTE**
This is a Beta feature and it is subject to change in the GA release 

~> **NOTE**
`ibm_is_share_replica_operations` is used for either failing over to replica share or splitting the source and replica shares. 
When a failover is performed, replica share becomes the source, and the source share becomes replica. Hence terraform configuration should be modified and adjusted accordingly.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// Split source share and replica share
resource "ibm_is_share_replica_operations" "test" {
  share_replica = ibm_is_share.replica.id
  split_share = true
}
```


```hcl
// failover to replica share
resource "ibm_is_share_replica_operations" "test" {
  share_replica = ibm_is_share.replica.id
  fallback_policy = "split"
  timeout = 500
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `share_replica` - (Required, string) The file share identifier.
- `fallback_policy` - (Optional, string) The action to take if the failover request is accepted but cannot be performed or times out. Accepted values are **split**, **fail**
- `timeout` - (Optional, string) The failover timeout in seconds. Required with `fallback_policy`
- `split_share` - (Boolean, string) If set to true the replication relationship between source share and replica will be removed.

~>**Note**

`split_share` and `fallback_policy` are mutually exclusive

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The unique identifier of the Share.
