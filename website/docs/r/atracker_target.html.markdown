# ibm_atracker_target

Provides a resource for Activity Tracker Target. This allows Activity Tracker Target to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_atracker_target" "atracker_target" {
  cos_endpoint {
     endpoint = "endpoint"
     target_crn = "target_crn"
     bucket = "bucket"
     api_key = "api_key"
  }
  name = "my-cos-target"
  target_type = "cloud_object_storage"
  region = "us-south"
}

resource "ibm_atracker_target" "atracker_logdna_target" {
  logdna_endpoint {
    target_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:logdna:us-south:a/11111111111111111111111111111111:22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222::"
    ingestion_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
  name = "my-logdna-target"
  target_type = "logdna"
  region = "us-south"
}

resource "ibm_atracker_target" "atracker_eventstreams_target" {
  eventstreams_endpoint {
    target_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:logdna:us-south:a/11111111111111111111111111111111:22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222::"
    brokers = ["xxxxx.cloud.ibm.com:9093","yyyyy.cloud.ibm.com:9093"]
    topic = "my-topic"
    api_key = "api-key"  // pragma: allowlist secret
  }
  name = "my-eventstreams-target"
  target_type = "event_streams"
  region = "us-south"
}

resource "ibm_atracker_target" "atracker_cloudlogs_target" {
  cloudlogs_endpoint {
    target_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:logs:eu-es:a/11111111111111111111111111111111:22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222::"
