### Sample to create a load balancer pool member for application load balancer.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_lb_pool_member" "testacc_lb_mem" {
  lb             = "daac2b08-fe8a-443b-9b06-1cef79922dce"
  pool           = "f087d3bd-3da8-452d-9ce4-c1010c9fec04"
  port           = 8080
  target_address = "127.0.0.1"
  weight         = 60
}

```

### Sample to create a load balancer pool member for network load balancer.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_lb_pool_member" "testacc_lb_mem" {
  lb             = "daac2b08-fe8a-443b-9b06-1cef79922dce"
  pool           = "f087d3bd-3da8-452d-9ce4-c1010c9fec04"
  port           = 8080
  target_id      = "54ad563a-0261-11e9-8317-bec54e704988"
