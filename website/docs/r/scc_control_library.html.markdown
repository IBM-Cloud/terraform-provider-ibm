# ibm_scc_control_library

Create, update, and delete control libraries by using this resource.

~> NOTE: Security Compliance Center is a regional service. Please specify the IBM Cloud Provider attribute `region` to target another region. Else, exporting the environmental variable IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT will also override which region is being targeted for all ibm providers(ex. `export IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT=https://eu-es.compliance.cloud.ibm.com`).

## Import

You can import the `ibm_scc_control_library` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `instance_id` and `control_library_id` in the following format:
```bash
<instance_id>/<control_library_id>
```
* `instance_id`: A string. The instance ID.
* `control_library_id`: A string. The control library ID.

# Syntax
```bash
$ terraform import ibm_scc_control_library.scc_control_library <instance_id>/<control_library_id>
```

# Example
```bash
$ terraform import ibm_scc_control_library.scc_control_library 00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444/f3517159-889e-4781-819a-89d89b747c85
