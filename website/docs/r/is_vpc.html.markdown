# ibm_is_vpc
Create, update, or delete a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). VPCs allow you to create your own space in IBM Cloud to run an isolated environment within the public cloud. VPC gives you the security of a private cloud, with the agility and ease of a public cloud. For more information, about VPC, see [getting started with Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
The following example to create a VPC:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

```

## Example usage
The following example to create a VPC with dns:

```terraform
// manual type resolver
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
  dns {
		enable_hub = true
		resolver {
			manual_servers {
				address = "192.168.3.4"
			}
		}
	}
}

resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example_vpc_manual" {
	name = "example-vpc-manual"
	dns {
		enable_hub = true
		resolver {
			manual_servers {
				address ="192.168.0.4"
				zone_affinity= "au-syd-1"
			}
			manual_servers {
				address =  "192.168.64.4"
				zone_affinity = "au-syd-2"
			}
			manual_servers {
				address= "192.168.128.4"
				zone_affinity ="au-syd-3"
			}
		}
	}
}

// system type resolver
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example-system" {
	name = "example-system-vpc"
	dns {
		enable_hub = false

    // uncommenting/patching vpc with below code would make the resolver type delegated
    # resolver {
		# 	type = "delegated"
		# 	vpc_id = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
		# }
	}
}

// delegated type resolver

resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example-delegated" {
  // required : add a dependency on ibm dns custom resolver of the hub vpc
	depends_on = [ ibm_dns_custom_resolver.example-hub ]
	name = "example-hub-false-delegated"
	dns {
		enable_hub = false
		resolver {
			type = "delegated"
			vpc_id = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
			dns_binding_name = "example-vpc-binding"
		}
	}
}

```

## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_vpc` resource provides the following [[Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create**: The creation of the VPC is considered `failed` when no response is received for 10 minutes. 
- **delete**: The deletion of the VPC is considered `failed` when no response is received for 10 minutes. 


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `access_tags`  - (Optional, List of Strings) A list of access management tags to attach to the bare metal server.

  ~> **Note:** 
  **&#x2022;** You can attach only those access tags that already exists.</br>
  **&#x2022;** For more information, about creating access tags, see [working with tags](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=ui#create-access-console).</br>
  **&#x2022;** You must have the access listed in the [Granting users access to tag resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access) for `access_tags`</br>
  **&#x2022;** `access_tags` must be in the format `key:value`.
- `address_prefix_management` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) Indicates whether a default address prefix should be created automatically `auto` or manually `manual` for each zone in this VPC. Default value is `auto`.
- `classic_access` - (Optional, Bool) Specify if you want to create a VPC that can connect to classic infrastructure resources. Enter **true** to set up private network connectivity from your VPC to classic infrastructure resources that are created in the same IBM Cloud account, and **false** to disable this access. If you choose to not set up this access, you cannot enable it after the VPC is created. Make sure to review the [prerequisites](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc#vpc-prerequisites) before you create a VPC with classic infrastructure access. Note that you can enable one VPC for classic infrastructure access per IBM Cloud account only.
- `default_network_acl_name` - (Optional, String) Enter the name of the default network access control list (ACL).
- `default_security_group_name` - (Optional, String) Enter the name of the default security group.
- `default_routing_table_name` - (Optional, String) Enter the name of the default routing table.

- `dns` - (Optional, List) The DNS configuration for this VPC.
  
  Nested scheme for `dns`:
  - `enable_hub` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether this VPC is enabled as a DNS name resolution hub.
  - `resolver` - (Optional, List) The zone list this backup policy plan will create snapshot clones in.
    Nested scheme for `resolver`:

      - `dns_binding_id` - (String) The VPC dns binding id whose DNS resolver provides the DNS server addresses for this VPC. (If any)
      - `dns_binding_name` - (Optional, String) The VPC dns binding name whose DNS resolver provides the DNS server addresses for this VPC. Only applicable for `delegated`, providing value would create binding with this name.

        ~> **Note:** 
          `manual_servers` must be set if and only if `dns.resolver.type` is manual.
      - `manual_servers` - (Optional, List) The DNS servers to use for this VPC, replacing any existing servers. All the DNS servers must either: **have a unique zone_affinity**, or **not have a zone_affinity**.

          Nested schema for **manual_servers**:

          - `address` - (Required, String) The IP address. This property may add support for IPv6 addresses in the future. When processing a value in this property, verify that the address is in an expected format. If it is not, log an error. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected IP address format was encountered.
          - `zone_affinity` - (Optional, List) If present, DHCP configuration for this zone will have this DNS server listed first.

        ~> **Note:** 
          While using `zone_affinity`, if fewer DNS servers are specified than the number of zones, then default servers will be created and terraform would show change. Its advised to provide `address` for all `zone_affinity`.


      - `type` - (Optional, String) The type of the DNS resolver to use. To update the resolver type, specify the `type` explicitly.

        ~> **Note:**

          `manual`: DNS server addresses are specified in `manual_servers`.<br/>
          `system`: DNS server addresses will be provided by the system and depend on the configuration.

        ~> **Note:** 
              Updating from `manual` requires dns resolver `manual_servers` to be specified as null.<br/>
              Updating to `manual` requires dns resolver `manual_servers` to be specified and not empty.<br/>
              Updating from `delegated` requires `dns.resolver.vpc` to be specified as null. If type is `delegated` while creation then `vpc_id` is required
