# ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline

Create, update, and delete cd_tekton_pipelines with this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline" "cd_tekton_pipeline_instance" {
  pipeline_id = "94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90"
  worker {
		id = "public"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

* `pipeline_id` - (Required, String) ID of the pipeline tool in your toolchain. Can be referenced from your `ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_pipeline` resource, e.g. `pipeline_id = ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_pipeline.my_pipeline.tool_id`
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z]+$/`.
* `enable_notifications` - (Optional, Boolean) Flag to enable notifications for this pipeline.
