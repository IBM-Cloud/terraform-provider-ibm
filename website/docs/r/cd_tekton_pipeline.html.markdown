# ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline

Provides a resource for cd_tekton_pipeline. This allows cd_tekton_pipeline to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline" "cd_tekton_pipeline_instance" {
  pipeline_id = "94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90"
  worker {
		id = "public"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

* `pipeline_id` - (Required, String) ID of the pipeline tool in your toolchain. Can be referenced from your `ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_pipeline` resource, e.g. `pipeline_id = ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_pipeline.my_pipeline.tool_id`
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z]+$/`.

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
