# ibm_pi_shared_processor_pool
Create, update or delete a shared processor pool.

## Example usage
The following example enables you to create a shared processor pool with a group 2 reserved cores on a s922 host group:

```terraform
resource "ibm_pi_shared_processor_pool" "testacc_shared_processor_pool" {
  pi_shared_processor_pool_name   = "my_spp"
  pi_shared_processor_pool_host_group = "s922"
  pi_shared_processor_pool_reserved_cores = "2"
  pi_cloud_instance_id      = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
}
```

**Note**
* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  
  Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```

- `pi_shared_processor_pool_placement_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the placement group the shared processor pool is created in.

## Attribute reference
 In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `allocated_cores` - (Float) The allocated cores in the shared processor pool.
- `available_cores` - (Integer) The available cores in the shared processor pool.
- `host_id` - (Integer) The host ID where the shared processor pool resides.

  Nested scheme for `instances`:
  - `availability_zone` - (String) Availability zone for the server instances.
  - `cpus` - (Integer) The amount of cpus for the server instance.
  - `id` - (String) The server instance ID.
  - `memory` - (Integer) The amount of memory for the server instance.
  - `name` - (String) The server instance name.
  - `status` - (String) Status of the instance.
  - `uncapped` - (Bool) Identifies if uncapped or not.
  - `vcpus` - (Float) The amout of vcpus for the server instance.
- `shared_processor_pool_id` - (String) The shared processor pool's unique ID.
