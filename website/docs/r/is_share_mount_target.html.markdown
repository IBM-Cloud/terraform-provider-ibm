# ibm\_is_share_mount_target

Provides a resource for ShareMountTarget. This allows ShareTarget to be created, updated and deleted.


~> **NOTE**
IBM CloudÂ® File Storage for VPC is available for customers with special approval. Contact your IBM Sales representative if you are interested in getting access.

~> **NOTE**
This is a Beta feature and it is subject to change in the GA release 

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name = "my-share"
  size = 200
  profile = "dp2"
  zone = "us-south-2"
}

resource "ibm_is_share_mount_target" "example" {
  share = ibm_is_share.is_share.id
  vpc = ibm_is_vpc.vpc.id
  name = "my-share-target"
}`
```
```
//Create mount target with virtual network interface that has primary ip name and subnet id
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  access_control_mode = "security_group"
  zone    = "br-sao-2"
  size    = 9600
  name    = "my-example-share1"
  profile = "dp2"
}
resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  # provider = ibm.sao
  name                     = "my-subnet"
  vpc                      = ibm_is_vpc.vpc2.id
  zone                     = "br-sao-2"
  total_ipv4_address_count = 16
}

resource "ibm_is_share_mount_target" "example1" {
  share = ibm_is_share.example.id
  virtual_network_interface {
    primary_ip {
      name = "my-example-pip"
    }
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    name = "my-example-vni"
  }
  name  = "my-example-mount-target"
}

//Create a mount target with subnet id
resource "ibm_is_share_mount_target" "example2" {
  share = ibm_is_share.example.id
  virtual_network_interface {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    name = "my-example-vni"
  }
  name  = "my-example-mount-target"
}

//Create mount target with reserved ip id
resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "example" {
  subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  name = "my-example-resip"
}
resource "ibm_is_share_mount_target" "mtarget1" {
  share = ibm_is_share.share.id
  virtual_network_interface {
    primary_ip {
      reserved_ip = ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip.example.reserved_ip
    }
    name = "my-example-vni"
  }
  name  = "my-example-mount-target"
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `share` - (Required, String) The file share identifier.
- `virtual_network_interface` (Optional, List) The virtual network interface for this share mount target. Required if the share's `access_control_mode` is `security_group`.
  - `name` - (Required, String) Name for this virtual network interface.
  Nested scheme for `virtual_network_interface`:
  - `primary_ip` - (Optional, List) The primary IP address to bind to the virtual network interface. May be either a reserved IP identity, or a reserved IP prototype object which will be used to create a new reserved IP.

      Nested scheme for `primary_ip`:
      - `auto_delete` - (Optional, Bool) Indicates whether this reserved IP member will be automatically deleted when either target is deleted, or the reserved IP is unbound. Defaults to `true`
      - `address` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The IP address to reserve. If unspecified, an available address on the subnet will automatically be selected.
      - `name`- (Optional, String) The name for this reserved IP. The name must not be used by another reserved IP in the subnet. Names starting with ibm- are reserved for provider-owned resources, and are not allowed.
      - `reserved_ip`- (Optional, String) The unique identifier for this reserved IP
  - `resource_group` - (Optional, String) The ID of the resource group to use.
  - `security_groups`- (Optional, List of string) The security groups to use for this virtual network interface.
  - `subnet` - (Optional, string) The associated subnet.
    
    ~> **Note**
    Within `primary_ip`, `reserved_ip` is mutually exclusive to  `auto_delete`, `address` and `name`

- `vpc` - (Optional, string) The VPC in which instances can mount the file share using this share target. Required if the share's `access_control_mode` is vpc.
  ~> **Note**
  `virtual_network_interface` and `vpc` are mutually exclusive and one of them must be provided.
- `name` - (Required, String) The user-defined name for this share target. Names must be unique within the share the share target resides in. If unspecified, the name will be a hyphenated list of randomly-selected words.
- `transit_encryption` - (Optional, String) The transit encryption mode for this share target. Supported values are **none**, **user_managed**. Default is **none**

~> **Note**
  `transit_encryption` can only be provided to create mount target for a share with `access_control_mode` `security_group`. It is not supported with shares that has `access_control_mode` `vpc`

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:


- `mount_target` - The unique identifier of the share target
- `created_at` - The date and time that the share target was created.
- `href` - The URL for this share target.
- `id` - The unique identifier of the ShareTarget. The id is composed of \<ibm_is_share_id\>/\<ibm_is_share_target_id\>
- `lifecycle_state` - The lifecycle state of the mount target.
- `mount_path` - The mount path for the share.The IP addresses used in the mount path are currently within the IBM services IP range, but are expected to change to be within one of the VPC's subnets in the future.
- `resource_type` - The type of resource referenced.
- `transit_encryption` - (String) The transit encryption mode for this share target.
