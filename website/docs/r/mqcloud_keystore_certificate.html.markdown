## Import

You can import the `ibm_mqcloud_keystore_certificate` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `service_instance_guid`, `queue_manager_id`, and `certificate_id` in the following format:

<pre>
&lt;service_instance_guid&gt;/&lt;queue_manager_id&gt;/&lt;certificate_id&gt;
</pre>
* `service_instance_guid`: A string in the format `a2b4d4bc-dadb-4637-bcec-9b7d1e723af8`. The GUID that uniquely identifies the MQ on Cloud service instance.
* `queue_manager_id`: A string in the format `b8e1aeda078009cf3db74e90d5d42328`. The id of the queue manager to retrieve its full details.
* `certificate_id`: A string. ID of the certificate.

> ### Important Note
> When configuring the `ibm_mqcloud_keystore_certificate` resource in the root module:
> Ensure to set the `certificate_file` value to an empty string (`certificate_file=""`). This step is crucial as we are not downloading the certificate to the local system.

# Syntax
<pre>
$ terraform import ibm_mqcloud_keystore_certificate.mqcloud_keystore_certificate &lt;service_instance_guid&gt;/&lt;queue_manager_id&gt;/&lt;certificate_id&gt;
