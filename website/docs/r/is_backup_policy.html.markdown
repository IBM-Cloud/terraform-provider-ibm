# ibm_is_backup_policy

Provides a resource for BackupPolicy. This allows BackupPolicy to be created, updated and deleted. For more information, about backup policy in your IBM Cloud VPC, see [Backup policy](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-policy-create).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.


**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_backup_policy" "example" {
  match_user_tags = ["tag1"]
  name            = "example-backup-policy"
}
```

## Example Usage (enterprise baas)

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_backup_policy" "ent-baas-example1" {
  match_user_tags = ["tag1"]
  name            = "example-backup-policy"
  scope {
    crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:is:us-south:a/123456::reservation:7187-ba49df72-37b8-43ac-98da-f8e029de0e63"
  }
}
```
