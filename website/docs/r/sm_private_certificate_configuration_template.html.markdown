# ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_template

Provides a resource for PrivateCertificateConfigurationTemplate. This allows PrivateCertificateConfigurationTemplate to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_template" "certificate_template" {
  instance_id           = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region                = "us-south"
  name                  = "my_template"
  certificate_authority = "my_intermediate_ca"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

* `allow_any_name` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request a private certificate that matches any common name.
* `allow_bare_domains` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request private certificates that match the value of the actual domains on the final certificate.For example, if you specify `example.com` in the `allowed_domains` field, you grant clients the ability to request a certificate that contains the name `example.com` as one of the DNS values on the final certificate.**Important:** In some scenarios, allowing bare domains can be considered a security risk.
* `allow_glob_domains` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether to allow glob patterns, for example, `ftp*.example.com`, in the names that are specified in the `allowed_domains` field.If set to `true`, clients are allowed to request private certificates with names that match the glob patterns.

This includes wildcard subdomains.For example, if `allowed_domains` has a value of `example.com` and `allow_subdomains`is set to `true`, then the following subdomains are allowed: `foo.example.com`, `bar.example.com`, `*.example.com`.**Note:** This field is redundant if you use the `allow_any_name` option.

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  - Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  - Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For iaas_classic_username
  - Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  - Click on user.
  - Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab
