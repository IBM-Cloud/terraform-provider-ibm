# ibm_en_destination_custom_email

Create, update, or delete a Custom Email destination by using IBM Cloudâ„¢ Event Notifications.

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_en_destination_custom_email" "custom_domain_en_destination" {
  instance_guid         = ibm_resource_instance.en_terraform_test_resource.guid
  name                  = "Custom Email EN Destination"
  type                  = "smtp_custom"
  collect_failed_events = true
  description           = "Destination Custom Email for event notification"
    config {
      params {
        domain  = "mailx.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Process To do the Custom Domain Configuration and Verification.

- Select the configure overflow menu for the destination you want to verify.

- Create Sender Policy Framework (SPF), which is used to authenticate the sender of an email. SPF specifies the mail servers that are allowed to send email for your domain.
    - Open your DNS hosting provider for the domain name configured
    - Create a new TXT record with your domain name registerer with the name and value provided in the configure screen for SPF

- Create DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), which allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message by signing it. DKIM allows the receiver to check the email that claimed to have come from a specific domain, is authorized by the owner of that domain.
    - Open your DNS hosting provider for the domain name configured
    - Create a new TXT record with your domain name registerer with the name and value provided in the configure screen for DKIM

- Save the TXT records

- In the destination verify screen, click on Verify buttons for both SPF and DKIM.
