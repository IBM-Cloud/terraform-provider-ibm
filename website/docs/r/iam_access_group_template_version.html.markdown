## Import

You can import the `ibm_iam_access_group_template_version` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `template_id`, and `version_num` in the following format:

```
<template_id>/<version_num>
```
* `template_id`: A string. ID of the template that you want to create a new version of.
* `version_num`: A string. version number in path.

# Syntax
```
$ terraform import ibm_iam_access_group_template_version.iam_access_group_template_version <template_id>/<version_num>
```
