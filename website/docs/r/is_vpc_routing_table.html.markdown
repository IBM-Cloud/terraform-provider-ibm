# ibm_is_vpc_routing_table
Create, update, or delete an VPC routing tables. For more information, about VPC routes, see [routing tables for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc (List)routing-tables-for-vpc).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```


## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}
resource "ibm_is_vpc_routing_table" "example" {
  vpc                           = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  name                          = "example-vpc-routing-table"
  route_direct_link_ingress     = true
  route_transit_gateway_ingress = false
  route_vpc_zone_ingress        = false
}

```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `created_at` - (Timestamp)  The date and time when the routing table was created.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The routing table name.
- `route_direct_link_ingress` - (Optional, Bool)  If set to **true**, the routing table is used to route traffic that originates from Direct Link to the VPC. To succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with the property set to **true**.
- `route_transit_gateway_ingress` - (Optional, Bool) If set to **true**, the routing table is used to route traffic that originates from Transit Gateway to the VPC. To succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with the property set to **true**.
- `route_vpc_zone_ingress` - (Optional, Bool) If set to true, the routing table is used to route traffic that originates from subnets in other zones in the VPC. To succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with the property set to **true**.
- `vpc` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The VPC ID. 

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `accept_routes_from_resource_type` - (List) The reource type filter specifying the resources that may create routes in this routing table.
- `href` - (String) The routing table URL.
- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the routing table. The ID is composed of `<vpc_id>/<vpc_routing_table_id>`.
- `is_default` - (String)  Indicates the default routing table for this VPC.
- `lifecycle_state` - (String) The lifecycle state of the routing table.
- `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
- `routing_table` - (String) The unique routing table identifier.
- `routes` - (List) The routes for the routing table.

  Nested scheme for `routes`:
  - `id` - (String) The unique ID of the route.
  - `name`-  (String) The user-defined name of the route.
- `subnets` - (List) The subnets to which routing table is attached.

  Nested scheme for `subnets`:
  - `id` - (String) The unique ID of the subnet.
  - `name` - (String) The user defined name of the subnet.

## Import
The `ibm_is_vpc_routing_table` resource can be imported by using VPC ID and VPC Route table ID.
