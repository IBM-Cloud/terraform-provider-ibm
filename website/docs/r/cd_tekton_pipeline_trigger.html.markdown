# ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger

Provides a resource for cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger. This allows cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger" "cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger_instance" {
  event_listener = "pr-listener"
  events = ["push", "pull_request" ]
  max_concurrent_runs = 3
  name = "Manual Trigger"
  pipeline_id = "94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90"
  source {
		type = "git"
		properties {
			url = "url"
			branch = "branch"
			pattern = "pattern"
		}
  }
  type = "manual"
  worker {
		id = "public"
  }
}
```

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  - Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  - Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For iaas_classic_username
  - Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  - Click on user.
  - Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab

For more informaton, see [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs#authentication).

## Import

You can import the `ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger` resource by using `id`.
The `id` property can be formed from `pipeline_id`, and `trigger_id` in the following format:

```
<pipeline_id>/<trigger_id>
```
* `pipeline_id`: A string in the format `94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90`. The Tekton pipeline ID.
* `trigger_id`: A string in the format `1bb892a1-2e04-4768-a369-b1159eace147`. The trigger ID.

# Syntax
```
$ terraform import ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger.cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger <pipeline_id>/<trigger_id>
```
