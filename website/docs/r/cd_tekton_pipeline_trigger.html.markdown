# ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger

Create, update, and delete cd_tekton_pipeline_triggers with this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger" "cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger_instance" {
  event_listener = "pr-listener"
  max_concurrent_runs = 3
  name = "Manual Trigger"
  pipeline_id = "94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90"
  type = "manual"
  worker {
    id = "public"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.
