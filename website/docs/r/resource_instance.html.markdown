# ibm_resource_instance
Create, update, or delete an IAM enabled service instance. For more information, about resource instance, see [assigning access to resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access-getstarted). 

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "test"
}

resource "ibm_resource_instance" "resource_instance" {
  name              = "test"
  service           = "cloud-object-storage"
  plan              = "lite"
  location          = "global"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  tags              = ["tag1", "tag2"]

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "15m"
    update = "15m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```
### Example to provision a Hyper Protect DBaaS service instance
The following example enables you to create a service instance of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB. For detailed argument reference, see the tables in the [Hyper Protect DBaaS for MongoDB documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb?topic=hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb-create-service&interface=cli#cli-create-service), or the [Hyper Protect DBaaS for PostgreSQL documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hyper-protect-dbaas-for-postgresql?topic=hyper-protect-dbaas-for-postgresql-create-service&interface=cli#cli-create-service) to create PostgreSQL service instances.
