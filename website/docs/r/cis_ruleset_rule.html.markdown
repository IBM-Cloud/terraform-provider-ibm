    cis_id    = ibm_cis.instance.id
    domain_id = data.ibm_cis_domain.cis_domain.domain_id
    ruleset_id = "943c5da120114ea5831dc1edf8b6f769"
      rule {
        action =  "execute"
        action_parameters  {
          id = var.to_be_deployed_ruleset.id
          overrides {
            action =  "block"
            enabled = true
            override_rules {
              rule_id = var.overriden_rule.id
              enabled = true
              action = "block"
            }
            categories {

        position {
          index = 1
          after = <id of any existing rule>
          before = <id of any existing rule>
        }
        description = var.rule.description
