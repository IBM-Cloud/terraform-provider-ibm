# ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret

Provides a resource for IAMCredentialsSecret. This allows IAMCredentialsSecret to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret" "sm_iam_credentials_secret" {
  instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region        = "us-south"
  name 			= "secret-name"
  access_groups = ["AccessGroupId-45884031-54be-4dd7-86ff-112511e92699"]
  custom_metadata = {"key":"value"}
  description = "Extended description for this secret."
  labels = ["my-label"]
  rotation {
		auto_rotate = true
		interval = 1
		unit = "day"
  }
  secret_group_id = "default"
  service_id = "ServiceId-bb4ccc31-bd31-493a-bb58-52ec399800be"
  ttl = "30m"
  reuse_api_key = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

* `access_groups` - (Optional, Forces new resource, List) Access Groups that you can use for an `iam_credentials` secret.Up to 10 Access Groups can be used for each secret.
  * Constraints: The list items must match regular expression `/^AccessGroupId-[a-z0-9-]+[a-z0-9]$/`. The maximum length is `10` items. The minimum length is `1` item.
* `custom_metadata` - (Optional, Map) The secret metadata that a user can customize.
* `description` - (Optional, String) An extended description of your secret.To protect your privacy, do not use personal data, such as your name or location, as a description for your secret group.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`.
* `labels` - (Optional, List) Labels that you can use to search for secrets in your instance.Up to 30 labels can be created.
  * Constraints: The list items must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`. The maximum length is `30` items. The minimum length is `0` items.
* `name` - (Required, String) The human-readable name of your secret.
    * Constraints: The maximum length is `256` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^\\w(([\\w-.]+)?\\w)?$/`.
* `reuse_api_key` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether to use the same service ID and API key for future read operations on an`iam_credentials` secret.If it is set to `true`, the service reuses the current credentials. If it is set to `false`, a new service ID and API key are generated each time that the secret is read or accessed.
* `rotation` - (Optional, List) Determines whether Secrets Manager rotates your secrets automatically.
Nested scheme for **rotation**:
	* `auto_rotate` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether Secrets Manager rotates your secret automatically.Default is `false`. If `auto_rotate` is set to `true` the service rotates your secret based on the defined interval.
	* `interval` - (Optional, Integer) The length of the secret rotation time interval.
	  * Constraints: The minimum value is `1`.
	* `rotate_keys` - (Optional, Boolean) Determines whether Secrets Manager rotates the private key for your public certificate automatically.Default is `false`. If it is set to `true`, the service generates and stores a new private key for your rotated certificate.
	* `unit` - (Optional, String) The units for the secret rotation time interval.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `day`, `month`.
* `secret_group_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) A v4 UUID identifier, or `default` secret group.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `7` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^([0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}|default)$/`.
* `service_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The service ID under which the API key (see the `api_key` field) is created.If you omit this parameter, Secrets Manager generates a new service ID for your secret at its creation and adds it to the access groups that you assign.Optionally, you can use this field to provide your own service ID if you prefer to manage its access directly or retain the service ID after your secret expires, is rotated, or deleted. If you provide a service ID, do not include the `access_groups` parameter.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `50` characters. The minimum length is `40` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9]*(?:-?[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$/`.
* `ttl` - (Optional, String) The time-to-live (TTL) or lease duration to assign to generated credentials.For `iam_credentials` secrets, the TTL defines for how long each generated API key remains valid. The value can be either an integer that specifies the number of seconds, or the string representation of a duration, such as `120m` or `24h`.Minimum duration is 1 minute. Maximum is 90 days.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `10` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[0-9]+[s,m,h,d]{0,1}$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your resource is created.

* `secret_id` - The unique identifier of the IAMCredentialsSecret.
* `api_key` - (String) The API key that is generated for this secret.After the secret reaches the end of its lease (see the `ttl` field), the API key is deleted automatically. If you want to continue to use the same API key for future read operations, see the `reuse_api_key` field.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `60` characters. The minimum length is `5` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^(?:[A-Za-z0-9_\\-]{4})*(?:[A-Za-z0-9_\\-]{2}==|[A-Za-z0-9_\\-]{3}=)?$/`.
* `api_key_id` - (String) The ID of the API key that is generated for this secret.
* `created_at` - (String) The date when a resource was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.
* `created_by` - (String) The unique identifier that is associated with the entity that created the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `4` characters.
* `crn` - (String) A CRN that uniquely identifies an IBM Cloud resource.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `512` characters. The minimum length is `9` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^crn:v[0-9](:([A-Za-z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=@\/]|%[0-9A-Z]{2})*){8}$/`.

* `service_id_is_static` - (Boolean) Indicates whether an `iam_credentials` secret was created with a static service ID.If it is set to `true`, the service ID for the secret was provided by the user at secret creation. If it is set to `false`, the service ID was generated by Secrets Manager.
* `state` - (Integer) The secret state that is based on NIST SP 800-57. States are integers and correspond to the `Pre-activation = 0`, `Active = 1`,  `Suspended = 2`, `Deactivated = 3`, and `Destroyed = 5` values.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`.

## Provider Configuration

The IBM Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

To find which credentials are required for this resource, see the service table [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters).

### Static credentials

You can provide your static credentials by adding the `ibmcloud_api_key`, `iaas_classic_username`, and `iaas_classic_api_key` arguments in the IBM Cloud provider block.

Usage:
```
provider "ibm" {
    ibmcloud_api_key = ""
    iaas_classic_username = ""
    iaas_classic_api_key = ""
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials by exporting the `IC_API_KEY`, `IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME`, and `IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY` environment variables, representing your IBM Cloud platform API key, IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name, and IBM Cloud infrastructure API key, respectively.

```
provider "ibm" {}
```

Usage:
```
export IC_API_KEY="ibmcloud_api_key"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME="iaas_classic_username"
export IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY="iaas_classic_api_key"
terraform plan
```

Note:

1. Create or find your `ibmcloud_api_key` and `iaas_classic_api_key` [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
  - Select `My IBM Cloud API Keys` option from view dropdown for `ibmcloud_api_key`
  - Select `Classic Infrastructure API Keys` option from view dropdown for `iaas_classic_api_key`
2. For iaas_classic_username
  - Go to [Users](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users)
  - Click on user.
  - Find user name in the `VPN password` section under `User Details` tab
