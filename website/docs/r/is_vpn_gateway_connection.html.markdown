# ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection
Create, update, or delete a VPN gateway connection. For more information, about VPN gateway, see [adding connections to a VPN gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-adding-connections).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```


## Example usage
The following example creates a VPN gateway:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name            = "example-subnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example2" {
  name            = "example-subnet2"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone            = "us-south-2"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.68.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  name   = "example-vpn-gateway"
  subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  mode   = "route"
}

resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "example" {
  name          = "example-vpn-gateway-connection"
  vpn_gateway   = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.id
  preshared_key = "VPNDemoPassword"
  # peer_address  = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address # deprecated, replaced with peer block
  # peer_cidrs    = [ibm_is_subnet.example2.ipv4_cidr_block] # deprecated, replaced with peer block
  peer {
      address  = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address
      cidrs    = [ibm_is_subnet.example2.ipv4_cidr_block]   
  }
  # local_cidrs   = [ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block] # deprecated, replaced with local block
  local {
      cidrs   = [ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block]
  }
}

```
## Example usage ( policy mode with an active peer VPN gateway )
The following example creates a VPN gateway:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  name   = "example-vpn-gateway"
  subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  mode   = "policy"
}

resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "example" {
  name          = "example-vpn-gateway-connection"
  vpn_gateway   = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.id
  preshared_key = "VPNDemoPassword"

  # local_cidrs   = [ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block] # depcreated
  local {
    cidrs = [ibm_is_subnet.example.ipv4_cidr_block]
  }
  # peer_cidrs    = [ibm_is_subnet.example2.ipv4_cidr_block] # depcreated
  # peer_address  = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address != "0.0.0.0" ? ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address : ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address2 # depcreated
  peer {
    address   = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address != "0.0.0.0" ? ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address : ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address2
    cidrs     = [ibm_is_subnet.example2.ipv4_cidr_block]
  }
}

```

## Timeouts
The `ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection` resource provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for deleting instance.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `action` - (Optional, String)  Dead peer detection actions. Supported values are **restart**, **clear**, **hold**, or **none**. Default value is `restart`.
- `admin_state_up` - (Optional, Bool) The VPN gateway connection status. Default value is **false**. If set to false, the VPN gateway connection is shut down.
- `distribute_traffic` - (Optional, Bool) Indicates whether the traffic is distributed between the `up` tunnels of the VPN gateway connection when the VPC route's next hop is a VPN connection. If `false`, the traffic is only routed through the `up` tunnel with the lower `public_ip` address. Distributing traffic across tunnels of route-based VPN gateway connections. Traffic across tunnels can be distributed with a status of up in a route-based VPN gateway connection. When creating or updating a route-based VPN gateway connection, set the distribute_traffic property to true (default is false). Existing connections will have the `distribute_traffic` property set to false.
- `establish_mode` - (Optional, String) The establish mode of the VPN gateway connection:- `bidirectional`: Either side of the VPN gateway can initiate IKE protocol   negotiations or rekeying processes.- `peer_only`: Only the peer can initiate IKE protocol negotiations for this VPN gateway   connection. Additionally, the peer is responsible for initiating the rekeying process   after the connection is established. If rekeying does not occur, the VPN gateway   connection will be brought down after its lifetime expires.
- `ike_policy` - (Optional, String) The ID of the IKE policy. Updating value from ID to `""` or making it `null` or removing it  will remove the existing policy.
- `interval` - (Optional, Integer) Dead peer detection interval in seconds. Default value is 2.
- `ipsec_policy` - (Optional, String) The ID of the IPSec policy. Updating value from ID to `""` or making it `null` or removing it  will remove the existing policy.
- `local` - (Optional, List) 
  Nested schema for **local**:

When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the backup policy on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
		- `value` - (Optional, String) The IKE identity FQDN value.
- `local_cidrs` - (Optional, DEPRECATED, Forces new resource, List) List of local CIDRs for this resource. `local_cidrs` is deprecated and use `local` block instead.

	  Nested schema for **ike_identity**:
		- `type` - (Required, String) The IKE identity type. [ **fqdn**, **hostname**, **ipv4_address**, **key_id** ] The enumerated values for this property will expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the backup policy on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
		- `value` - (Optional, String) The IKE identity FQDN value.
	- `type` - (Computed, String) Indicates whether `peer.address` or `peer.fqdn` is used.

- `peer_cidrs` - (Optional, DEPRECATED, Forces new resource, List) List of peer CIDRs for this resource. `peer_cidrs` is deprecated and use `peer` block instead.
