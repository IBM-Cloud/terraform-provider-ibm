# ibm_pi_dhcp

Create, update, or delete DHCP Server for your Power Systems Virtual Server instance. For more information, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example usage
The following example enables you to create a DHCP Server:

```terraform
resource "ibm_pi_dhcp" "example" {
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
}
```

**Note**

* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  
  Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```

## Timeouts

The `ibm_pi_dhcp` provides the following [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **create** - (Default 30 minutes) Used for creating a DHCP Server.
- **delete** - (Default 10 minutes) Used for deleting a DHCP Server.

## Argument reference

Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `pi_cloud_instance_id` - (Required, String) The GUID of the service instance associated with an account.
- `pi_cloud_connection_id` - (Optional, String) The Cloud Connection UUID to connect with DHCP private network.

## Attribute reference

In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute reference after your resource is created.

- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the DHCP Server. The ID is composed of `<power_instance_id>/<dhcp_id>`.
- `dhcp_id` - (String) The ID of the DHCP Server.
- `leases` - (List) The list of DHCP Server PVM Instance leases.

  Nested scheme for `leases`:
  - `instance_ip` - (String) The IP of the PVM Instance.
  - `instance_mac` - (String) The MAC Address of the PVM Instance.
- `network` - (String) The DHCP Server private network.
- `status` - (String) The status of the DHCP Server.

## Import

The `ibm_pi_dhcp` resource can be imported by using `pi_cloud_instance_id` and `dhcp_id`.

**Example**

```sh
$ terraform import ibm_pi_dhcp.example d7bec597-4726-451f-8a63-e62e6f19c32c/0e48e1be-9f54-4a67-ba55-7e31ce98b65a
