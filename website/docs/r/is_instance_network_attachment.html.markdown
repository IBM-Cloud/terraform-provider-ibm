# ibm_is_instance_network_attachment

Create, update, and delete Instance Network Attachment with this resource.
Instance network attachments allow you to create and manage additional virtual network interfaces to your compute instances using virtual service instance network attachment.

## Example Usage

### Basic usage with existing virtual network interface

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_instance_network_attachment" "example" {
  instance = ibm_is_instance.example.id
  name     = "example-networkatt"
  virtual_network_interface {
    id = ibm_is_virtual_network_interface.example.id
  }
}
```

### Inline virtual network interface with auto-assigned IP

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_instance_network_attachment" "example2" {
  instance = ibm_is_instance.example.id
  name     = "example-networkatt2"
  virtual_network_interface {
    name                     = "example-vni-2"
    subnet                   = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    auto_delete              = true
    allow_ip_spoofing        = false
    enable_infrastructure_nat = true
    security_groups = [
      ibm_is_security_group.example.id
    ]
  }
}
```

### Inline virtual network interface with specific primary IP address

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_instance_network_attachment" "example3" {
  instance = ibm_is_instance.example.id
  name     = "example-networkatt3"
  virtual_network_interface {
    name                     	= "example-vni-3"
    subnet                   	= ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    auto_delete              	= true
    allow_ip_spoofing        	= false
    enable_infrastructure_nat 	= true
    primary_ip {
      address     = "10.240.64.100"
      auto_delete = true
      name        = "example-primary-ip-1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced configuration with reserved IPs

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "example_primary" {
  subnet  = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  name    = "example-primary-ip"
  address = "10.240.65.50"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip" "example_additional" {
  subnet  = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  name    = "example-additional-ip"
  address = "10.240.65.51"
}

resource "ibm_is_instance_network_attachment" "example4" {
  instance = ibm_is_instance.example.id
  name     = "example-networkatt4"
  virtual_network_interface {
    name                     = "example-vni-5"
    subnet                   = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
    auto_delete              = true
    allow_ip_spoofing        = false
    enable_infrastructure_nat = true
    primary_ip {
      reserved_ip = ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip.example_primary.reserved_ip
    }
    ips {
      reserved_ip = ibm_is_subnet_reserved_ip.example_additional.reserved_ip
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this resource.

- `instance` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The virtual server instance identifier.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name for this instance network attachment. The name is unique across all network attachments for the instance.
- `virtual_network_interface` - (Required, List) The virtual network interface for this instance network attachment. This can be specified using an existing virtual network interface ID, or a prototype object for a new virtual network interface.

	Nested schema for **virtual_network_interface**:
  - `crn` - (String) The CRN for this virtual network interface.
	- `id` - (Optional, String) The unique identifier for an existing virtual network interface. When specified, all other nested arguments are ignored and will conflict if provided.
	- `allow_ip_spoofing` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If `false`, source IP spoofing is prevented on this interface. If `true`, source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. Conflicts with `id`.
	- `auto_delete` - (Optional, Boolean) Indicates whether this virtual network interface will be automatically deleted when `target` is deleted. Conflicts with `id`.
	- `enable_infrastructure_nat` - (Optional, Boolean) If `true`: The VPC infrastructure performs any needed NAT operations. `floating_ips` must not have more than one floating IP. If `false`: Packets are passed unchanged to/from the network interface, allowing the workload to perform any needed NAT operations. `allow_ip_spoofing` must be `false`. If the virtual network interface is attached: The target `resource_type` must be `bare_metal_server_network_attachment`. The target `interface_type` must not be `hipersocket`. Conflicts with `id`.
