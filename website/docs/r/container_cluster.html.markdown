# ibm_container_cluster
Create, update, or delete an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud single zone cluster. Every cluster is set up with a worker pools that is named `default` and that holds worker nodes with the same configuration, such as machine type, CPU, and memory.

If you want to use this resource to update a cluster, make sure that you review the [version changelog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) for patch updates and the [version information and update information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) for major and minor changes. 

If you want to create a VPC cluster, make sure to include the VPC infrastructure generation in the `provider` block of your  Terraform configuration file. If you do not set this value, the generation is automatically set to 2. For more information, about how to configure the `provider` block, see [Overview of required input parameters for each resource category](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-reference#required-parameters). 

You cannot create a free cluster in IBM Cloud Schematics.

To create a worker pool or add worker nodes and zones to a worker pool, use the `ibm_container_worker_pool` and `ibm_container_worker_pool_zone` resources. 

For step-by-step instructions for how to create an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster, see [Creating single and multizone Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-tutorial-tf-clusters). 

## Example usage

### Classic IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster
The following example creates a single zone IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster that is named `mycluster` with one worker node in the default worker pool.

```terraform
resource "ibm_container_cluster" "testacc_cluster" {
  name            = "test"
  datacenter      = "dal10"
  machine_type    = "free"
  hardware        = "shared"
  public_vlan_id  = "vlan"
  private_vlan_id = "vlan"
  subnet_id       = ["1154643"]

## Timeouts

The `ibm_container_alb` provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/syntax.html) configuration options:

- **Create** The enablement of the feature is considered `failed` if no response is received for 90 minutes.
- **Delete** The delete of the feature is considered `failed` if no response is received for 45 minutes.
- **Update** The update of the feature is considered `failed` if no response is received for 45 minutes.


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource. 

- `datacenter` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The datacenter where you want to provision the worker nodes. The zone that you choose must be supported in the region where you want to create the cluster. To find supported zones, run `ibmcloud ks zones` [command line](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
- `default_pool_size`  - (Optional, Integer) The number of worker nodes that you want to add to the default worker pool.
- `disk_encryption` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Bool) If set to **true**, the worker node disks are set up with an AES 256-bit encryption. If set to **false**, the disk encryption for the worker node is disabled. For more information, see [Encrypted disks for worker node](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#workernodes).
- `entitlement` - (Optional, String) If you purchased an IBM Cloud Cloud Pak that includes an entitlement to run worker nodes that are installed with OpenShift Container Platform, enter `entitlement` to create your cluster with that entitlement so that you are not charged twice for the OpenShift license. Note that this option can be set only when you create the cluster. After the cluster is created, the cost for the OpenShift license occurred and you cannot disable this charge. **Note**
  1. Set only for the first time creation of the cluster, modification do not have any impacts.
  2. Set this argument to `cloud_pak` only if you use this cluster with a Cloud Pak that has an OpenShift entitlement.
- `force_delete_storage` - (Optional, Bool) If set to **true**,force the removal of persistent storage associated with the cluster during cluster deletion. Default value is **false**. **NOTE** If `force_delete_storage` parameter is used after provisioning the cluster, then, you need to execute `terraform apply` before `terraform destroy` for `force_delete_storage` parameter to take effect.
- `hardware` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The level of hardware isolation for your worker node. Use `dedicated` to have available physical resources dedicated to you only, or `shared` to allow physical resources to be shared with other IBM customers. This option is available for virtual machine worker node flavors only.
- `gateway_enabled` - (Optional, Bool) Set to **true** if you want to automatically create a gateway-enabled cluster. If `gateway_enabled` is set to **true**, then `private_service_endpoint` must be set to **true** at the same time.
- `kms_config` - (Optional, List) Used to attach a Key Protect instance to a cluster. Nested `kms_config` block have `instance_id`, `crk_id`, `private_endpoint` structure.

  Nested scheme for `kms_config`:
  - `crk_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the customer root key (CRK).
  - `instance_id` - (Optional, String) The GUID of the Key Protect instance.
  - `private_endpoint` - (Optional, Bool) Set to **true** to configure the KMS private service endpoint. Default value is **false**.
- `kube_version` - (Optional, String) The Kubernetes or OpenShift version that you want to set up in your cluster. If the version is not specified, the default version in [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) or [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_versions#version_types) is used. For example, to specify Kubernetes version 1.16, enter `1.16`. For OpenShift clusters, you can specify version `3.11_openshift` or `4.3.1_openshift`.
- `labels`- (Optional, Map) Labels on all the workers in the default worker pool.
- `machine_type` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The machine type for your worker node. The machine type determines the amount of memory, CPU, and disk space that is available to the worker node. For an overview of supported machine types, see [Planning your worker node setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes). You can retrieve the value by executing the `ibmcloud ks machine-types <data-center>` command in the IBM Cloud CLI.
- `name` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The name of the cluster. The name must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, and hyphen (-), and must be 35 characters or fewer. Use a name that is unique across regions. The cluster name and the region in which the cluster is deployed form the fully qualified domain name for the Ingress subdomain. To ensure that the Ingress subdomain is unique within a region, the cluster name might be truncated and appended with a random value within the Ingress domain name.
- `no_subnet` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Bool) If set to **true**, no portable subnet is created during cluster creation. The portable subnet is used to provide portable IP addresses for the Ingress subdomain and Kubernetes load balancer services. If set to **false**, a portable subnet is created by default. The default is **false**.
- `patch_version` - (Optional, String) Updates the worker nodes with the required patch version. The patch_version should be in the format:  `patch_version_fixpack_version`. For more information, about Kubernetes version information and update, see [Kubernetes version update](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions). **NOTE:** To update the patch or fix pack versions of the worker nodes, run the command `ibmcloud ks workers -c <cluster_name_or_id> output json`. Fetch the required patch & fix pack versions from `kubeVersion.target` and set the `patch_version` parameter.
- `public_service_endpoint` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Bool) If set to **true**, your cluster is set up with a public service endpoint. You can use the public service endpoint to access the Kubernetes master from the public network. To use service endpoints, your account must be enabled for [Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf). For more information, see [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication: Service endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#workeruser-master). If set to **false**, the public service endpoint is disabled for your cluster.
- `public_vlan_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the public VLAN that you want to use for your worker nodes. You can retrieve the VLAN ID with the `ibmcloud ks vlans zone <zone>` command. </br></br> * **Free clusters**: If you want to provision a free cluster, you do not need to enter a public VLAN ID. Your cluster is automatically connected to a public VLAN that is owned by IBM. </br> * **Standard clusters**: If you create a standard cluster and you have an existing public VLAN ID for the zone where you plan to set up worker nodes, you must enter the VLAN ID. To retrieve the ID, run `ibmcloud ks vlans zone <zone>`. If you do not have an existing public VLAN ID, or you want to connect your cluster to a private VLAN only, do not specify this option. **Note**: The prerequisite for using service endpoints, account must be enabled for [Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/direct-link/vrf-on-ibm-cloud.html#overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud). Account must be enabled for connectivity to service endpoints. Use the resource `ibm_container_cluster_feature` to update the `public_service_endpoint` and `private_service_endpoint`. 
- `private_service_endpoint` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Bool) If set to **true**, your cluster is set up with a private service endpoint. When the private service endpoint is enabled, communication between the Kubernetes and the worker nodes is established over the private network. If you enable the private service endpoint, you cannot disable it later. To use service endpoints, your account must be enabled for [Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf). For more information, see [Worker-to-master and user-to-master communication: Service endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#workeruser-master). If set to **false**, the private service endpoint is disabled and all communication to the Kubernetes master must go through the public network.
- `private_vlan_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The ID of the private VLAN that you want to use for your worker nodes. You can retrieve the VLAN ID with the `ibmcloud ks vlans zone <zone>` command. </br></br> * **Free clusters**: If you want to provision a free cluster, you do not need to enter a private VLAN ID. Your cluster is automatically connected to a private VLAN that is owned by IBM. </br> * **Standard clusters**: If you create a standard cluster and you have an existing private VLAN ID for the zone where you plan to set up worker nodes, you must enter the VLAN ID. To retrieve the ID, run `ibmcloud ks vlans zone <zone>`. If you do not have an existing private VLAN ID, do not specify this option. A private VLAN is created automatically for you.
- `pod_subnet`-  (Optional, String) Specify a custom subnet CIDR to provide private IP addresses for pods. The subnet must be at least `/23` or more. For more information, refer to [Pod subnet](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#pod-subnet).Yes-
- `resource_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the resource group where you want to provision your cluster. To retrieve the ID, use the  `ibm_resource_group` data source. If no value is provided, the cluster is automatically provisioned into the `default` resource group.
