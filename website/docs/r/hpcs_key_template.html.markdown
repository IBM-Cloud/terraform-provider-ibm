# ibm_hpcs_key_template

Provides a resource for key_template. This allows key_template to be created, updated and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_hpcs_key_template" "key_template_instance" {
  instance_id = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.instance_id
  region      = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.region
  uko_vault   = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.vault_id
  vault {
    id = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault_instance.vault_id
  }
  name        = "terraformKeyTemplate"
  description = "example key template"
  key {
    size            = "256"
    algorithm       = "aes"
    activation_date = "P5Y1M1W2D"
    expiration_date = "P1Y2M1W4D"
    state           = "active"
  }
  keystores {
    group = "Production"
    type  = "aws_kms"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource.

* `instance_id` - (Required, String) ID of UKO Instance
  * Constraints: Must match the ID of the UKO instance you are trying to work with.
* `region` - (Required, String) Region of the UKO Instance
  * Constraints: Must match the region of the UKO instance you are trying to work with. Allowable values are: `au-syd`, `in-che`, `jp-osa`, `jp-tok`, `kr-seo`, `eu-de`, `eu-gb`, `ca-tor`, `us-south`, `us-south-test`, `us-east`, `br-sao`.
* `description` - (Optional, String) Description of the key template.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `200` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.|\\n)*/`.
* `key` - (Required, List) Properties describing the properties of the managed key.
Nested scheme for **key**:
	* `activation_date` - (Required, String) Key activation date can be provided as a period definition (e.g. PY1 means 1 year).
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `100` characters. The minimum length is `3` characters. The value must match regular expression `/P^[0-9YMWD]+$/`.
	* `algorithm` - (Required, String) The algorithm of the key.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `aes`, `rsa`.
	* `expiration_date` - (Required, String) Key expiration date can be provided as a period definition (e.g. PY1 means 1 year).
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `100` characters. The minimum length is `3` characters. The value must match regular expression `/P^[0-9YMWD]+$/`.
	* `size` - (Required, String) The size of the underlying cryptographic key or key pair. E.g. "256" for AES keys, or "2048" for RSA.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `100` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/`.
	* `state` - (Required, String) The state that the key will be in after generation.
	  * Constraints: The default value is `active`. Allowable values are: `pre_activation`, `active`.
* `keystores` - (Required, List) An array describing the type and group of target keystores the managed key is to be installed in.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1` item. The minimum length is `1` item.
Nested scheme for **keystores**:
	* `group` - (Required, String) Which keystore group to distribute the key to.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `200` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-_ ]+$/`.
	* `type` - (Required, String) Type of keystore.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `aws_kms`, `azure_key_vault`, `ibm_cloud_kms`.
* `name` - (Required, String) Name of the template, it will be referenced when creating managed keys.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `30` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9-]*$/`.
* `uko_vault` - (Required, String) The UUID of the Vault in which the update is to take place.
* `vault` - (Required, List) ID of the Vault where the entity is to be created in.
Nested scheme for **vault**:
	* `id` - (Required, String) The v4 UUID used to uniquely identify the resource, as specified by RFC 4122.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your resource is created.

* `template_id` - The unique identifier of the key_template.
* `created_at` - (String) Date and time when the key template was created.
* `created_by` - (String) ID of the user that created the key template.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `100` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9-]+$/`.
* `href` - (String) A URL that uniquely identifies your cloud resource.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `200` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9._~:\/?&=-]+$/`.
* `updated_at` - (String) Date and time when the key template was updated.
* `updated_by` - (String) ID of the user that updated the key.
