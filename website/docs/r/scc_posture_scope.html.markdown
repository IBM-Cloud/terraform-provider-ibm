# ibm_scc_posture_scope

Provides a resource for scopes. This allows scopes to be created, updated and deleted. Before creation of the scope, we need to create credential and collector.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_scc_posture_scope" "scopes" {
  credential_id = "5"
  credential_type = "on_premise"
  description = "IBMSchema"
  interval = 10
  is_discovery_scheduled = true
  name = "IBMSchema-new-048-test"
}
```

## Argument Reference
