# ibm_is_vpc_address_prefix
Create, update, or delete an IP address prefix. For more information, about IS VPC address prefix, see [address prefixes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain#address-prefixes).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_vpc_address_prefix" "example" {
  name = "example-address-prefix"
  zone = "us-south-1"
  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  cidr = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

```
