# ibm_is_dedicated_hosts
Retrieve the dedicated hosts. For more information, about dedicated hosts in the IBM Cloud VPC, see [dedicated hosts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-dedicated-hosts-instances).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_dedicated_hosts" "is_dedicated_hosts" {
	host_group = "1e09281b-f177-46fb-baf1-bc152b2e391a"
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source.

- `host_group` - (Optional, String) The unique identifier of the dedicated host group.


## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 

- `id` -  (String) The unique identifier of the dedicated host collection.
- `dedicated_hosts` -  (List) Collection of dedicated hosts. Nested dedicated_hosts blocks have the following structure.

  Nested scheme for `dedicated_hosts`:
  - `available_memory` -  (String) The amount of memory in GB that is currently available for 
  - `available_vcpu` -  (List) The available `VCPU` for the dedicated host. Nested available_vcpu blocks have the following structure.

    Nested scheme for `available_vcpu`:
    - `architecture` -  (String) The `VCPU` architecture.
    - `count` -  (String) The number of `VCPUs` assigned.
  - `created_at` -  (Timestamp) The date and time that the dedicated host was created.
  - `crn` -  (String) The CRN for this dedicated host.
  - `disks` - (List) Collection of the dedicated host's disks.

    Nested scheme for `disks`:
    - `available` - (String) The remaining space left for instance placement in GB (gigabytes).
    - `created_at` - (Timestamp) The date and time that the disk was created.
    - `href` - (String) The URL for this disk.
    - `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this disk.
    - `instance_disks` - (List) Instance disks that are on this dedicated host disk. 
      
      Nested scheme for `instance_disks`:
      - `deleted` - (List) If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and providessome supplementary information.

         Nested scheme for `deleted`:

      - `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
    - `interface_type` - (String) The disk interface used for attaching the disk. The enumerated values for this property are expected to expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally, halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
    - `lifecycle_state` - (String) The lifecycle state of this dedicated host disk.
    - `name` - (String) The user-defined or system-provided name for this disk.
