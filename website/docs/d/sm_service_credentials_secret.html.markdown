# ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret

Provides a read-only data source for a service credentials secret. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.
The data source can be defined by providing the secret ID or the secret and secret group names.

## Example Usage

By secret id
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret" "service_credentials_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  secret_id = "0b5571f7-21e6-42b7-91c5-3f5ac9793a46"
}
```

By secret name and group name
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret" "service_credentials_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  name          = "secret-name"
  secret_group_name = "group-name"
}
```

### Example to access resource credentials using credentials attribute:

```terraform
data "ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret" "service_credentials_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  secret_id = "0b5571f7-21e6-42b7-91c5-3f5ac9793a46"
}
output "access_key_id" {
  value = data.ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret.service_credentials_secret.credentials["cos_hmac_keys.access_key_id"]
}
output "secret_access_key" {
  value = data.ibm_sm_service_credentials_secret.service_credentials_secret.credentials["cos_hmac_keys.secret_access_key"]
}
```
