# ibm\_is_vpc_address_prefix

Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud AddressPrefixCollection. For more information, about IS VPC address prefix, see [address prefixes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain#address-prefixes).


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_vpc_address_prefixes" "is_vpc_address_prefix_name" {
  vpc  = "r134-b5938d43-cb2f-4666-bc99-9410863ed305"
  name = "outsider-sense-motor-chomp"
}
```

## Argument Reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `name` - (Optional, string) The user-defined name for this address prefix. Names must be unique within the VPC the address prefix resides in.
- `vpc`  - (Required, string) The VPC identifier.

## Attribute Reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `address_prefixes` - Collection of address prefixes. 
- `id` - The unique identifier of the AddressPrefixCollection.
- `total_count` - The total number of resources across all pages.

Nested `address_prefixes` blocks have the following structure:
- `created_at` - The date and time that the prefix was created.
- `cidr` - The CIDR block for this prefix.
- `has_subnets` - Indicates whether subnets exist with addresses from this prefix.
- `href` - The URL for this address prefix.
- `id` - The unique identifier for this address prefix.
- `is_default` - Indicates whether this is the default prefix for this zone in this VPC. If a default prefix was automatically created when the VPC was created, the prefix is automatically named using a hyphenated list of randomly-selected words, but may be updated with a user-specified name.
- `name` - The user-defined name for this address prefix. Names must be unique within the VPC the address prefix resides in.
- `zone` - The zone this address prefix resides in. 

Nested `zone` blocks have the following structure:
- `href` - The URL for this zone.
- `name` - The globally unique name for this zone.
