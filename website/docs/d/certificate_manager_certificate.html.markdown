# ibm_certificate_manager_certificate

Retrieve the details of an existing certificate instance resource and lists all the certificates. For more information, about Certificate Manager, see [getting started with Certificate Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/certificate-manager?topic=certificate-manager-getting-started).


## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_instance" "cm" {
    name     = "testname"
    location = "us-south"
    service  = "cloudcerts"
}
data "ibm_certificate_manager_certificate" "source_certificate"{
    certificate_manager_instance_id=data.ibm_resource_instance.cm.id
    name = "certificate name"
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument reference that you can specify for your resource. 
 
- `certificate_manager_instance_id` - (Required, String) The CRN of the certificate manager service instance.
- `name` - (Required, String) The display name for the certificate.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument references list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.


- `certificate_details` - (String) List of certificates for the provided name.
   
   Nested scheme for `certificate_details`:
   - `algorithm` - (String) The algorithm that is used for the certificate. 
   - `begins_on`- (Timestamp) The timestamp when the certificate was created in UNIX epoch time format. 
   - `cert_id` - (String) The CRN based certificate ID. 
   - `domains` - (Array) A list of domains that the certificate is associated with. The first domain is referred to as the primary domain. Any more domains are referred to as secondary domains.
    - `data` - (String) The certificate data.
      
       Nested scheme for `data`:
       - `content` - (String) The content of certificate data, escaped.

   - `serial_number` - (String) The serial number of the certificate.
   - `status` - (String) The status of the certificate.
- `id` - (String) The ID of the certificate that is managed in Certificate Manager. The ID is composed of `<certificate_manager_instance_ID>:<certificate_ID>`.
