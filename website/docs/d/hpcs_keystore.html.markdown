# ibm_hpcs_keystore

Provides a read-only data source for keystore. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_hpcs_keystore" "keystore" {
  instance_id = "76195d24-8a31-4c6d-9050-c35f09375cfb"
  region = "us-east"
  keystore_id = "d8cc1ef7-d13b-4731-95be-1f7c98c9f524"
  uko_vault = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault.vault_id
}
```
