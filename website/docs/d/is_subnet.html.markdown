# ibm_is_subnet
Retrieve information of an existing VPC Generation 2 compute subnet as a read only data source. For more information, about the IBM Cloud subnet, see [attaching subnets to a routing table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-attach-subnets-routing-table).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
Example to retrieve the subnet information by using subnet name.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name            = "example-subnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

data "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name = ibm_is_subnet.example.name
}

```
// Example to retrieve the subnet information by using subnet ID.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name            = "example-subnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

data "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  identifier = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
}

```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `identifier` - (Optional, String) The ID of the subnet,`name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the subnet,`name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 

- `access_tags`  - (String) Access management tags associated for the instance.
- `available_ipv4_address_count` - (Integer) The total number of available IPv4 addresses.
- `crn` - (String) The CRN of subnet.
- `id` - (String) The unique ID of the subnet.
- `ipv4_cidr_block` -  (String) The IPv4 range of the subnet.
- `ip_version` - (String) The IP version.
- `name` - (String) The name of the subnet.
- `network_acl` - (String) The ID of the network ACL for the subnet.
- `public_gateway` - (String) The ID of the public gateway for the subnet.
- `resource_group` - (String) The subnet resource group.
- `routing_table` -  (List) The routing table for this subnet. 
  
  Nested scheme for `routing_table`:
  - `deleted` -  (List) If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and provides some supplementary information.

    Nested scheme for `deleted`:
    - `more_info` -  (String) Link to documentation about deleted resources.
  - `href` -  (String) The URL for this routing table.
  - `id` -  (String) The unique identifier for this routing table.
  - `name` -  (String) The user-defined name for this routing table.
  - `resource_type` -  (String) The type of resource referenced.
- `status` - (String) The status of the subnet.
- `tags`  - (String) Tags associated for the instance.
- `total_ipv4_address_count` - (Integer) The total number of IPv4 addresses.
- `vpc` - (String) The ID of the VPC that the subnet belongs to.
- `vpc_name` - (String) The name of the VPC that the subnet belongs to.
- `zone` - (String) The subnet zone name.
