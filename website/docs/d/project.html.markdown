# ibm_project

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a project. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_project" "project" {
	project_id = ibm_project.project_instance.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `project_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The unique project ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[\\.\\-0-9a-zA-Z]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the project.
* `configs` - (List) The project configurations. These configurations are only included in the response of creating a project if a configuration array is specified in the request payload.
  * Constraints: The default value is `[]`. The maximum length is `100` items. The minimum length is `0` items.
Nested schema for **configs**:

I you're importing from an existing Schematics workspace that is not backed by cart, a `locator_id` is required.
