# ibm_is_instance_groups

Provides a read-only data source for InstanceGroupCollection. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about instance groups , see [Managing instance groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-instance-group&mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=instance+group).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are regional specific and by default targets to `us-south`. If VPC service is created in a region other than `us-south`, please make sure to target the region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, .

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_instance_groups" "is_instance_groups" {
}
```
