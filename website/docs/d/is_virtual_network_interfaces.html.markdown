# ibm_is_virtual_network_interfaces

Provides a read-only data source for VirtualNetworkInterfaceCollection. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_virtual_network_interfaces" "example" {
}
```


## Attribute Reference

- `resource_group` - (Optional, String) The ID of the Resource group these virtual network interfaces belong to.

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `virtual_network_interfaces` - (List) Collection of virtual network interfaces.
	Nested scheme for **virtual_network_interfaces**:
	- `access_tags`  - (Array of Strings) Access management tags associated for the virtual network interface.
	- `allow_ip_spoofing` - (Boolean) Indicates whether source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If `false`, source IP spoofing is prevented on this interface. If `true`, source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface.
	- `auto_delete` - (Boolean) Indicates whether this virtual network interface will be automatically deleted when`target` is deleted.
	- `created_at` - (String) The date and time that the virtual network interface was created.
	- `crn` - (String) The CRN for this virtual network interface.
	- `enable_infrastructure_nat` - (Boolean) If `true`:- The VPC infrastructure performs any needed NAT operations.- `floating_ips` must not have more than one floating IP.If `false`:- Packets are passed unchanged to/from the virtual network interface,  allowing the workload to perform any needed NAT operations.- `allow_ip_spoofing` must be `false`.- If the virtual network interface is attached:  - The target `resource_type` must be `bare_metal_server_network_attachment`.  - The target `interface_type` must not be `hipersocket`.
	- `href` - (String) The URL for this virtual network interface.
	- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this virtual network interface.
	- `ips` - (List) The reserved IPs bound to this virtual network interface.May be empty when `lifecycle_state` is `pending`.
		Nested schema for **ips**:
		- `address` - (String) The IP address.If the address has not yet been selected, the value will be `0.0.0.0`.This property may add support for IPv6 addresses in the future. When processing a value in this property, verify that the address is in an expected format. If it is not, log an error. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected IP address format was encountered.

	- `mac_address` - (String) The MAC address of the virtual network interface. May be absent if `lifecycle_state` is `pending`.
	- `name` - (String) The name for this virtual network interface. The name is unique across all virtual network interfaces in the VPC.
	- `primary_ip` - (List) The reserved IP for this virtual network interface.May be absent when `lifecycle_state` is `pending`.
