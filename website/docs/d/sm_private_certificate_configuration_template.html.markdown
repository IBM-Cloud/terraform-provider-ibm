# ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_template

Provides a read-only data source for PrivateCertificateConfigurationTemplate. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_template" {
  instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region        = "us-south"
  name = "configuration-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `name` - (Required, String) The name of the configuration.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9]*(?:_?-?\\.?[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the PrivateCertificateConfigurationTemplate.
* `allow_any_name` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request a private certificate that matches any common name.

* `allow_bare_domains` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request private certificates that match the value of the actual domains on the final certificate.For example, if you specify `example.com` in the `allowed_domains` field, you grant clients the ability to request a certificate that contains the name `example.com` as one of the DNS values on the final certificate.**Important:** In some scenarios, allowing bare domains can be considered a security risk.

* `allow_glob_domains` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow glob patterns, for example, `ftp*.example.com`, in the names that are specified in the `allowed_domains` field.If set to `true`, clients are allowed to request private certificates with names that match the glob patterns.

* `allow_ip_sans` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request a private certificate with IP Subject Alternative Names.

* `allow_localhost` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow `localhost` to be included as one of the requested common names.

* `allow_subdomains` - (Boolean) Determines whether to allow clients to request private certificates with common names (CN) that are subdomains of the CNs that are allowed by the other certificate template options. This includes wildcard subdomains.For example, if `allowed_domains` has a value of `example.com` and `allow_subdomains`is set to `true`, then the following subdomains are allowed: `foo.example.com`, `bar.example.com`, `*.example.com`.**Note:** This field is redundant if you use the `allow_any_name` option.
