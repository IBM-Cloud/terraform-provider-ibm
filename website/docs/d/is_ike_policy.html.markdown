# ibm_is_ike_policy

Provides a read-only data source for IKEPolicy. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about managing IBM Cloud VPN Gateway and IKE policy , see [about site-to-site VPN gateways](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=ui#policy-negotiation).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_ike_policy" "example" {
  name                     = "my-ike-policy"
  authentication_algorithm = "md5"
  encryption_algorithm     = "triple_des"
  dh_group                 = 2
  ike_version              = 1
}

data "ibm_is_ike_policy" "example" {
  ike_policy = ibm_is_ike_policy.example.id
}
```

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_ike_policy" "example" {
  name                     = "my-ike-policy"
  authentication_algorithm = "md5"
  encryption_algorithm     = "triple_des"
  dh_group                 = 2
  ike_version              = 1
}

data "ibm_is_ike_policy" "example" {
  name = ibm_is_ike_policy.example.name
}
```
## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

- `ike_policy` - (Optional, String) The IKE policy identifier.
    ~> **NOTE** : One of `ike_policy` or  `name` is required

- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the IKE policy
    ~> **NOTE** : One of `ike_policy` or  `name` is required

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the IKEPolicy.
