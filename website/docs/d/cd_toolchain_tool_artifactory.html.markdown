# ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_artifactory

Provides a read-only data source for cd_toolchain_tool_artifactory. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

See the [tool integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-artifactory) page for more information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_artifactory" "cd_toolchain_tool_artifactory" {
	tool_id = "9603dcd4-3c86-44f8-8d0a-9427369878cf"
	toolchain_id = data.ibm_cd_toolchain.cd_toolchain.id
}
```

## Argument Reference
