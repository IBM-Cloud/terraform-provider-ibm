# ibm_scc_posture_scan_summaries

Provides a read-only data source for scan_summaries. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_scc_posture_scan_summaries" "scan_summaries" {
	report_setting_id = "report_setting_id"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `report_setting_id` - (Required, String) The report setting ID. This can be obtained from the /validations/latest_scans API call.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `20` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[0-9]*$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the scan_summaries.
* `first` - (List) The URL of a page.
Nested scheme for **first**:
	* `href` - (String) The URL of a page.

* `last` - (List) The URL of a page.
Nested scheme for **last**:
	* `href` - (String) The URL of a page.

* `previous` - (List) The URL of a page.
Nested scheme for **previous**:
	* `href` - (String) The URL of a page.

* `summaries` - (List) Summaries.
Nested scheme for **summaries**:
	* `end_time` - (String) The date and time the scan completed.
	* `group_profiles` - (List) The list of group profiles.
	Nested scheme for **group_profiles**:
		* `id` - (String) The ID of the profile.
		* `name` - (String) The name of the profile.
