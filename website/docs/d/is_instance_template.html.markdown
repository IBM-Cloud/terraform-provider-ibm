# ibm_is_instance_template
Retrieve information of an existing IBM VPC instance template. For more information, about VPC instance templates, see [creating an instance template](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-instance-template).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage
In the following example, you can get information of an instance template of VPC Generation-2 infrastructure by either name or identifier.

```terraform	
data "ibm_is_instance_template" "example" {
  name = "example-instance-template"
}
```

```terraform	
data "ibm_is_instance_template" "example" {
  identifier = ibm_is_instance_template.example.id
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `identifier` - (Optional, String) The id of the instance template, `name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the instance template, `name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.



## Attribute reference
You can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 
- `availability_policy_host_failure` - (String) The availability policy for this virtual server instance. The action to perform if the compute host experiences a failure. 

- `boot_volume` - (List) A nested block describes the boot volume configuration for the template.

	Nested scheme for `boot_volume`:
	- `delete_volume_on_instance_delete` - (String) You can configure to delete the boot volume based on instance deletion.
	- `encryption` - (String) The encryption key CRN such as HPCS, Key Protect, etc., is provided to encrypt the boot volume attached.
	- `iops` - (String) The IOPS for the boot volume.

- `crn` - (String) The CRN of the instance template.
- `default_trusted_profile_auto_link` - (Boolean) If set to `true`, the system will create a link to the specified `target` trusted profile during instance creation. Regardless of whether a link is created by the system or manually using the IAM Identity service, it will be automatically deleted when the instance is deleted. Default is true. 
- `default_trusted_profile_target` - (String) The unique identifier or CRN of the default IAM trusted profile to use for this virtual server instance.
- `href` - (String) The URL of the instance template.
- `id` - (String) The ID of the instance template.
- `image` - (String) The ID of the image to create the template.
- `keys` - (String) List of SSH key IDs used to allow log in user to the instances.
- `metadata_service_enabled` - (Boolean) Indicates whether the metadata service endpoint is available to the virtual server instance.
- `name` - (String) The name of the instance template.
- `network_interfaces` - (List) A nested block describes the network interfaces for the template.

	Nested scheme for `network_interfaces`:
	- `name` - (String) The name of the interface.
	- `primary_ipv4_address` - (String) The IPv4 address assigned to the network interface.
	- `subnet` - (String) The VPC subnet to assign to the interface.
	- `security_groups` - (String) List of security groups of  the subnet.
	
- `placement_target` - (List) The placement restrictions to use for the virtual server instance.
  Nested scheme for `placement_target`:
    - `crn` - (String) The unique identifier for this placement target.
    - `href` - (String) The CRN for this placement target.
    - `id` - (String) The URL for this placement target.
		
- `profile` - (String) The number of instances created in the instance group.
- `primary_network_interfaces` - (List) A nested block describes the primary network interface for the template.

	Nested scheme for `primary_network_interfaces`:
	- `name` - (String) The name of the interface.
	- `primary_ipv4_address` - (String) The IPv4 address assigned to the primary network interface.
	- `subnet` - (String) The VPC subnet to assign to the interface.
	- `security_groups` - (String) List of security groups of the subnet.
- `resource_group` - (String) The resource group ID.	
- `total_volume_bandwidth` - (Integer) The amount of bandwidth (in megabits per second) allocated exclusively to instance storage volumes
- `user_data` -  (String) The user data provided for the instance.
- `volume_attachments` - (List) A nested block describes the storage volume configuration for the template.

	Nested scheme for `volume_attachments`:
