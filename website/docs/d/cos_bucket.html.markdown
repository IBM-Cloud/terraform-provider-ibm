# ibm_cos_bucket

Retrive an IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket. It also allows object storage buckets to be updated and deleted. The ibmcloud_api_key used by Terraform must have been granted sufficient IAM rights to create and modify IBM Cloud Object Storage buckets and have access to the Resource Group the Cloud Object Storage bucket will be associated with. See https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam for more details on setting IAM and Access Group rights to manage COS buckets.

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_resource_group" "cos_group" {
  name = "cos-resource-group"
}

data "ibm_resource_instance" "cos_instance" {
  name              = "cos-instance"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.cos_group.id
  service           = "cloud-object-storage"
}

data "ibm_cos_bucket" "standard-ams03" {
  bucket_name          = "a-standard-bucket-at-ams"
  resource_instance_id = data.ibm_resource_instance.cos_instance.id
  bucket_type          = "single_site_location"
  bucket_region        = "ams03"
}

output "bucket_private_endpoint" {
  value = data.ibm_cos_bucket.standard-ams03.s3_endpoint_private
}
```

# cos satellite bucket

Retrive a cos satellite bucket. See the architecture https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cos-satellite for more details. We are using existing cos instance to create bucket , so no need to create any cos instance via a terraform. Cos satellite does not support all features see the section **What features are currently supported?** in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cos-satellite.
IBM Satellite documentation https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-getting-started . We are supporting object versioning and expiration features as of now. Firewall is not supported yet.

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_satellite_location" "location" {
  location  = var.location
}

data "ibm_cos_bucket" "cos-bucket-sat" {
  bucket_name           = "cos-sat-terraform"
  resource_instance_id  = data.ibm_resource_instance.cos_instance.id
  satellite_location_id  = data.ibm_satellite_location.location.id
}
```

# ibm_cos_bucket_replication_rule

Retrieves information of replication configuration on an existing bucket. .  For more information, about configuration options, see [Replicating objects](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-replication-overview). 

To configure a replication policy on a bucket, you must enable object versioning on both source and destination buckets by using the [Versioning objects](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-versioning).

# Key Protect Enabled COS bucket

# Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS) Enabled COS bucket
