# ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_jenkins

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about cd_toolchain_tool_jenkins. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

See the [tool integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-jenkins) page for more information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_jenkins" "cd_toolchain_tool_jenkins" {
	tool_id = "9603dcd4-3c86-44f8-8d0a-9427369878cf"
	toolchain_id = data.ibm_cd_toolchain.cd_toolchain.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `tool_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) ID of the tool bound to the toolchain.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-4[a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[89abAB][a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}$/`.
* `toolchain_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) ID of the toolchain.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-4[a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[89abAB][a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the cd_toolchain_tool_jenkins.
* `crn` - (String) Tool CRN.

* `href` - (String) URI representing the tool.

* `name` - (String) Name of the tool.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^([^\\x00-\\x7F]|[a-zA-Z0-9-._ ])+$/`.

* `parameters` - (List) Unique key-value pairs representing parameters to be used to create the tool. A list of parameters for each tool integration can be found in the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-integrations">Configuring tool integrations page</a>.
Nested schema for **parameters**:
	* `api_token` - (String) The API token to use for Jenkins REST API calls so that DevOps Insights can collect data from Jenkins. You can find the API token on the configuration page of your Jenkins instance. You can use a toolchain secret reference for this parameter. For more information, see [Protecting your sensitive data in Continuous Delivery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_data_security#cd_secure_credentials).
	* `api_user_name` - (String) The user name to use with the Jenkins server's API token, which is required so that DevOps Insights can collect data from Jenkins. You can find your API user name on the configuration page of your Jenkins instance.
	* `dashboard_url` - (String) The URL of the Jenkins server dashboard for this integration. In the graphical UI, this is the dashboard that the browser will navigate to when you click the Jenkins integration tile.
	* `name` - (String) The name for this tool integration.
	* `webhook_url` - (String) The webhook to use in your Jenkins jobs to send notifications to other tools in your toolchain.

* `referent` - (List) Information on URIs to access this resource through the UI or API.
Nested schema for **referent**:
	* `api_href` - (String) URI representing this resource through an API.
	* `ui_href` - (String) URI representing this resource through the UI.

* `resource_group_id` - (String) Resource group where the tool is located.

* `state` - (String) Current configuration state of the tool.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `configured`, `configuring`, `misconfigured`, `unconfigured`.

* `toolchain_crn` - (String) CRN of toolchain which the tool is bound to.


* `updated_at` - (String) Latest tool update timestamp.
