# ibm_schematics_workspace
Retrieve information about a Schematics workspace. For more details about the Schematics and Schematics workspace, see [setting up workspaces](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started).

## Example usage

```terraform

	workspace_id = "workspace_id"
}
```

## Argument reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `location` - (Optional,String) Location supported by IBM Cloud Schematics service.  While creating your workspace or action, choose the right region, since it cannot be changed.  Note, this does not limit the location of the IBM Cloud resources, provisioned using Schematics.

* `status` - (String) The status of the workspace.   **Active**: After you successfully ran your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the state of your workspace changes to `Active`.   **Connecting**: Schematics tries to connect to the template in your source repo. If successfully connected, the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input parameters, is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of the workspace changes to `Scanning`.   **Draft**: The workspace is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab repository.   **Failed**: If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure code in IBM Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to `Failed`.   **Inactive**: The Terraform template was scanned successfully and the workspace creation is complete. You can now start running Schematics plan and apply jobs to provision the IBM Cloud resources that you specified in your template. If you have an `Active` workspace and decide to remove all your resources, your workspace is set to `Inactive` after all your resources are removed.   **In progress**: When you instruct IBM Cloud Schematics to run your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes to `In progress`.   **Scanning**: The download of the Terraform template is complete and vulnerability scanning started. If the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to `Inactive`. If errors in your template are found, the state changes to `Template Error`.   **Stopped**: The Schematics plan, apply, or destroy job was cancelled manually.   **Template Error**: The Schematics template contains errors and cannot be processed.
