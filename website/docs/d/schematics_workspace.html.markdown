```

## Argument reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

Schematics uses the statefile as an inventory list to determine future create, update, or deletion jobs.

* `shared_data` - (Optional, List) Information about the Target used by the templates originating from IBM Cloud catalog offerings. This information is not relevant when you create a workspace from your own Terraform template.
Nested scheme for **shared_data**:
	* `cluster_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the cluster where you want to provision the resources of all IBM Cloud catalog templates that are included in the catalog offering.

	* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the resource group that you want to use for the resources of all IBM Cloud catalog templates that are included in the catalog offering.

* `status` - (Optional, String) The status of the workspace.   **Active**: After you successfully ran your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the state of your workspace changes to `Active`.   **Connecting**: Schematics tries to connect to the template in your source repo. If successfully connected, the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input parameters, is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of the workspace changes to `Scanning`.   **Draft**: The workspace is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab repository.   **Failed**: If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure code in IBM Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to `Failed`.   **Inactive**: The Terraform template was scanned successfully and the workspace creation is complete. You can now start running Schematics plan and apply jobs to provision the IBM Cloud resources that you specified in your template. If you have an `Active` workspace and decide to remove all your resources, your workspace is set to `Inactive` after all your resources are removed.   **In progress**: When you instruct IBM Cloud Schematics to run your infrastructure code by applying your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes to `In progress`.   **Scanning**: The download of the Terraform template is complete and vulnerability scanning started. If the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to `Inactive`. If errors in your template are found, the state changes to `Template Error`.   **Stopped**: The Schematics plan, apply, or destroy job was cancelled manually.   **Template Error**: The Schematics template contains errors and cannot be processed.

* `template_uninstall_script_name` - (Optional, String) Uninstall script name.

* `template_values` - (Optional, String) A list of variable values that you want to apply during the Helm chart installation. The list must be provided in JSON format, such as `"autoscaling: enabled: true minReplicas: 2"`. The values that you define here override the default Helm chart values. This field is supported only for IBM Cloud catalog offerings that are provisioned by using the Terraform Helm provider.

* `template_values_metadata` - (Optional, List) A list of input variables that are associated with the workspace.

* `template_inputs` - (Optional, List) Information about the input variables that your template uses.
