# ibm_is_virtual_network_interface

Provides a read-only data source for VirtualNetworkInterface. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my-vpc"
}
resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name                     = "example-subnet"
  vpc                      = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone                     = "us-south-1"
  total_ipv4_address_count = 256
}
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name = "my-share"
  access_control_mode = "security_group"
  size = 200
  profile = "dp2"
  zone = "us-south-2"
}
resource "ibm_is_share_mount_target" "example" {
  share = ibm_is_share.example.id
  virtual_network_interface {
    name = "my-virtual_network_interface"
    primary_ip {
      address = "10.240.64.5"
      auto_delete = true
      name = "my-reserved-ip"
    }
    name = "my-share-target"
  }
}

data "ibm_is_virtual_network_interface" "example" {
	virtual_network_interface = ibm_is_share_mount_target.example.virtual_network_interface.0.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

- `virtual_network_interface` - (Required, String) The virtual network interface identifier.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `access_tags`  - (Array of Strings) Access management tags associated for the virtual network interface.
- `allow_ip_spoofing` - (Boolean) Indicates whether source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface. If `false`, source IP spoofing is prevented on this interface. If `true`, source IP spoofing is allowed on this interface.
- `auto_delete` - (Boolean) Indicates whether this virtual network interface will be automatically deleted when`target` is deleted.
- `created_at` - (String) The date and time that the virtual network interface was created.
- `crn` - (String) The CRN for this virtual network interface.
- `enable_infrastructure_nat` - (Boolean) If `true`:- The VPC infrastructure performs any needed NAT operations.- `floating_ips` must not have more than one floating IP.If `false`:- Packets are passed unchanged to/from the virtual network interface,  allowing the workload to perform any needed NAT operations.- `allow_ip_spoofing` must be `false`.- If the virtual network interface is attached:  - The target `resource_type` must be `bare_metal_server_network_attachment`.  - The target `interface_type` must not be `hipersocket`.

Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the resource on which the unexpected IP address format was encountered.
