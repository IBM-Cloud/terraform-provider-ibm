# ibm_container_cluster
Retrieve information about an existing IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster. For more information, about container cluster, see [about Kubernetes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started).


## Example usage
The following example retrieves information about a cluster that is named `mycluster`. 

```terraform
data "ibm_container_cluster" "cluster" {
  cluster_name_id = "mycluster"
}
```

The following example retrieves the name of the cluster.

```terraform
data "ibm_container_cluster" "cluster_foo" {
  name = "FOO"
}
```
## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 
 
- `alb_type` - (Optional, String) Filters the  `albs` based on type. The valid values are `private`, `public`, and `all`. The default value is `all`.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name or ID of the cluster.
- `list_bounded_services`- (Optional, Bool) If set to **false** services which are bound to the cluster are not going to be listed. The default value is **true**.
- `resource_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the resource group where your cluster is provisioned into. To list resource groups, run `ibmcloud resource groups` or use the `ibm_resource_group` data source.

**Deprecated reference**

- `account_guid` - (Deprecated, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud account associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_account` data source or by running the `ibmcloud iam accounts` command in the IBM Cloud CLI.
- `cluster_name_id` - (Deprecated, String) The name or ID of the cluster that you want to retrieve.
- `org_guid` - (Deprecated, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud organization associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_org` data source or by running the `ibmcloud iam orgs`.
- `guid` command in the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
- `space_guid` - (Deprecated, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud space associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_space` data source or by running the `ibmcloud iam space <space-name> --guid` command in the IBM Cloud CLI.
- `region` - (Deprecated, string) The region where the cluster is provisioned. If the region is not specified it will be defaulted to provider region(IC_REGION/IBMCLOUD_REGION). To get the list of supported regions please access this [link](https://containers.bluemix.net/v1/regions) and use the alias.

## Attribute reference

- `public_service_endpoint_url` - (String) The URL of the public service endpoint for your cluster.
- `private_service_endpoint` -  (Bool) Indicates if the private service endpoint is enabled (**true**) or disabled (**false**) for a cluster. 
- `private_service_endpoint_url` - (String) The URL of the private service endpoint for your cluster.
- `vlans`- (List of objects) A list of VLANs that are attached to the cluster. 

  Nested scheme for `vlans`:
