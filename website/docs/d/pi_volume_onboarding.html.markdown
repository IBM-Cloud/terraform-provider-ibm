## Example usage
The following example retrieves information about about volume onboarding in Power Systems Virtual Server.

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_volume_onboarding" "ds_volume_onboarding" {
  pi_cloud_instance_id    = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
  pi_volume_onboarding_id = "1212a6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7343"
}
```

**Notes**
- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
