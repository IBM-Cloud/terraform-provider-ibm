# ibm_iam_access_group_template

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about an iam_access_group_template. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_iam_access_group_template" "iam_access_group_template" {
	account_id = "accountID-123"
	verbose = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `account_id` - (Required, String) Enterprise account ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `50` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`.
