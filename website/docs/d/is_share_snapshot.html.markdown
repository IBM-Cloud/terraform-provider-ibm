# ibm_is_share_snapshot

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a ShareSnapshot. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_is_share_snapshot" "is_share_snapshot" {
	is_share_snapshot_id = ibm_is_share_snapshot.is_share_snapshot_instance.is_share_snapshot_id
	share_id = ibm_is_share_snapshot.is_share_snapshot_instance.share_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `is_share_snapshot_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The share snapshot identifier.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.
* `share_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The file share identifier.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-z_]+$/`.
