# ibm_is_vpcs
Retrieve information of an existing VPCs. For more information, about VPC, see [getting started with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

data "ibm_is_vpcs" "example" {
}

```
