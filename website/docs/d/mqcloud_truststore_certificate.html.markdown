# ibm_mqcloud_truststore_certificate

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a mqcloud_truststore_certificate. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_mqcloud_truststore_certificate" "mqcloud_truststore_certificate" {
	label = ibm_mqcloud_truststore_certificate.mqcloud_truststore_certificate_instance.label
	queue_manager_id = ibm_mqcloud_truststore_certificate.mqcloud_truststore_certificate_instance.queue_manager_id
	service_instance_guid = ibm_mqcloud_truststore_certificate.mqcloud_truststore_certificate_instance.service_instance_guid
}
```
