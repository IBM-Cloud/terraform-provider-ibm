## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "example-share"
  size    = 200
  profile = "dp2"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
}

resource "ibm_is_share_target" "example" {
  share = ibm_is_share.is_share.id
  vpc   = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  name  = "example-share-target"
}

data "ibm_is_share_target" "example" {
  share        = ibm_is_share.example.id
  share_target = ibm_is_share_target.example.share_target
}
```
