# ibm_pi_hosts

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about hosts. For more information, about IBM power virtual server cloud, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_hosts" "hosts" {
    pi_cloud_instance_id  = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
    
}

  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
