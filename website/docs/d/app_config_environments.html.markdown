# ibm_app_config_environments

Retrieve information about an existing IBM Cloud App Configuration environments. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about App Configuration environments, see [Managing access levels for App Configuration environments](https://cloud.ibm.com//docs/app-configuration?topic=app-configuration-ac-service-access-level-management).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_app_config_environments" "app_config_environments" {
  guid = "guid"
  tags = "tags"
  expand = "expand"
  limit = "limit"
  offset = "limit"
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

- `guid` - (Required, String) guid of the App Configuration service. Get it from the service instance credentials section of the dashboard.
- `tags` - (Optional, String) Filter the resources to be returned based on the associated tags. Returns resources associated with any of the specified tags.
- `expand` - (Optional, Bool) If set to `true`, returns expanded view of the resource details.
- `limit` - (Optional, Integer) The number of records to retrieve. By default, the list operation return the first 10 records. To retrieve different set of records, use `limit` with `offset` to page through the available records.
