# ibm_project_config

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a project_config. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_project_config" "project_config" {
	project_config_id = ibm_project_config.project_config_instance.project_config_id
	project_id = ibm_project_config.project_config_instance.project_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `project_config_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The unique configuration ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[\\.\\-0-9a-zA-Z]+$/`.
