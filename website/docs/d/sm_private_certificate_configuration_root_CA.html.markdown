# ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_root_ca

Provides a read-only data source for PrivateCertificateConfigurationRootCA. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_sm_private_certificate_configuration_root_ca" {
  instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region        = "us-south"
  name = "configuration-name"
}
```
