# ibm_is_dedicated_host_profiles
Retrieve an information about the dedicated host profiles. For more information, about dedicated host profiles, see [dedicated host profiles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_dedicated_host_profiles" "is_dedicated_host_profiles" {
}
```


## Argument reference
