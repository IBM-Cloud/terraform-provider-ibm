# ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateways
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud infrastructure virtual endpoint gateways as a read-only data source. For more information, about the VPC endpoint gateways, see [creating an endpoint gateway](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ordering-endpoint-gateway).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_virtual_endpoint_gateways" "data_test" {
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `gateway`- (Required, String) The endpoint gateway ID.

## Attribute reference
In addition to the argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 

- `created_at` - (Timestamp) The created date and time of the endpoint gateway.
- `health_state` - (String) The endpoint gateway health state. **ok: Healthy**, **degraded: Suffering from compromised performance, capacity, or connectivity**, **faulted: Completely unreachable, inoperative, or entirely incapacitated**, **inapplicable: The health state does not apply because of the current lifecycle state**. A resource with a lifecycle state of failed or deleting will have a health state of inapplicable. A pending resource may have this state.
- `lifecycle_state` - (String) The endpoint gateway lifecycle state, supported values are `deleted`, `deleting`, `failed`, `pending`, `stable`, `updating`, `waiting`, `suspended`.
- `id` - (String) The endpoint gateway ID.
- `ips` - (List) The collection of reserved IPs bound to an endpoint gateway.

  Nested scheme for `ips`:
	- `ips.id` - (String) The unique identifier for the reserved IP.
	- `ips.name` - (String) The user defined or system provided name of the resource IP.
	- `ips.resource_type` - (String) The endpoint gateway IP resource type or the subnet reserved IP.
- `name` - (String) The endpoint gateway name.
- `resource_group` - (String) The unique identifier for the resource group.
- `target` - (List) The endpoint gateway target services.

  Nested scheme for `target`:
  - `name` - (String) The endpoint gateway target name.
  - `resource_type` - (String) The endpoint gateway target resource type.
- `vpc` - (String) The VPC ID.
