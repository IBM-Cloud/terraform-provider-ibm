# ibm_project_environment

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a project_environment. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_project_environment" "project_environment" {
	project_environment_id = ibm_project_environment.project_environment_instance.project_environment_id
	project_id = ibm_project_environment.project_environment_instance.project_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `project_environment_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The environment ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `256` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^(?!\\s)(?!.*\\s$).+$/`.
* `project_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The unique project ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[\\.\\-0-9a-zA-Z]+$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the project_environment.
* `created_at` - (String) A date and time value in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ to match the date and time format as specified by RFC 3339.
