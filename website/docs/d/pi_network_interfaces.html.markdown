# ibm_pi_network_interfaces

Retrieve information about network interfaces.

## Example Usage

```terraform
    data "ibm_pi_network_interfaces" "network_interfaces" {
        pi_cloud_instance_id = "<value of the cloud_instance_id>"
        pi_network_id = "network_id"
    }
```

### Notes

- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
