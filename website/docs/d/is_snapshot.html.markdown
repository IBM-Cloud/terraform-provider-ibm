# ibm_is_snapshot

Import the details of existing IBM Cloud infrastructure snapshot as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about infrastructure snapshots, see [viewing snapshots](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-view).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```
