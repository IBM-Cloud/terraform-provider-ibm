# ibm_container_vpc_cluster
Retrieve information about a VPC cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. For more information, about VPC cluster, see [about IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started).
​
## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_container_vpc_cluster" "cluster" {
  name  = "no-zones-tf"
  resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source. 

- `alb_type` - (Optional, String) The ALB type of a cluster.
- `cluster_name_id` - (Deprecated, String) The name or ID of the VPC cluster that you want to retrieve.
- `name` - (Optional, String) The name or ID of the cluster.
- `resource_group_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the resource group where your cluster is provisioned into. To list resource groups, run `ibmcloud resource groups` or use the `ibm_resource_group` data source.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created. 

- `api_key_id` - (String) The ID of the API key.

	- `resize` -  (Bool)  Indicate whether resizing should be done. 
- `crn` - (String) The CRN of the cluster.
- `health` - (String) The health of the cluster master.
- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the cluster.
- `ingress_hostname`-  (String) The hostname that was assigned to your Ingress subdomain. 
- `ingress_secret` - (String) The name of the Kubernetes secret that was created for your Ingress subdomain.
- `kube_version` - (String) The Kubernetes version of the cluster, including the major.minor version.
- `master_url` - (String) The URL of the cluster master.
- `name` - (String) The name of the cluster.
- `public_service_endpoint` -  (Bool) Indicates if the public service endpoint is enabled (**true**) or disabled (**false**) for a cluster. 
- `public_service_endpoint_url` - (String) The URL of the public service endpoint for your cluster.
- `private_service_endpoint` -  (Bool) Indicates if the private service endpoint is enabled (**true**) or disabled (**false**) for a cluster. 
- `private_service_endpoint_url` - (String) The URL of the private service endpoint for your cluster.
- `status` - (String) The status of the cluster master.
- `worker_count` - (Integer) The number of worker nodes per zone in the default worker pool. Default value ‘1’.
- `workers` - List of objects - A list of worker nodes that belong to the cluster. 
- `worker_pools` - List of objects - A list of worker pools that exist in the cluster.

  Nested scheme for `worker_pools`:
  - `flavor` - (String) The flavor that is used for the worker nodes in the worker pool.
	- `name` - (String) The name of the worker pool.
	- `worker_count` - (Integer) The total number of worker nodes in this worker pool.
	- `isolation` - (String) The level of hardware isolation for the worker node. For VPC clusters, this value is always `shared`.
	- `id` - (String) The ID of the worker pool.
	- `labels` - List of strings - A list of labels that are added to the worker pool.
	- `zones` - List of objects - A list of zones that are attached to the worker pool.

	  Nested scheme for `zones`:
