  pi_key_name          = "terraform-test-key"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```

- `pi_cloud_instance_id` - (Required, String) Cloud Instance ID of a PCloud Instance.
- `pi_key_name`  - (Required, String) User defined name for the SSH key. 

## Attribute reference

**Notes**

* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`

Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
