# ibm_pi_key
Retrieve information about the SSH key that is used for your Power Systems Virtual Server instance. The SSH key is used to access the instance after it is created. For more information, about [configuring your IBM i virtual machine (VM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-configuring-ibmi).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_key" "ds_instance" {
  pi_key_name          = "terraform-test-key"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```

**Notes**

* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`

Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
