## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_mqcloud_queue_manager_status" "mqcloud_queue_manager_status" {
	queue_manager_id = var.queue_manager_id
	service_instance_guid = var.service_instance_guid
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `queue_manager_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The id of the queue manager to retrieve its full details.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `32` characters. The minimum length is `32` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[0-9a-fA-F]{32}$/`.
* `service_instance_guid` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The GUID that uniquely identifies the MQ on Cloud service instance.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the mqcloud_queue_manager_status.
* `status` - (String) The deploying and failed states are not queue manager states, they are states which can occur when the request to deploy has been fired, or with that request has failed without producing a queue manager to have any state. The other states map to the queue manager states. State "ending" is either quiesing or ending immediately. State "ended" is either ended normally or endedimmediately. The others map one to one with queue manager states.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `initializing`, `deploying`, `starting`, `running`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `status_not_available`, `deleting`, `failed`, `upgrading_version`, `updating_revision`, `initialization_failed`, `restoring_queue_manager`, `restoring_config`, `restore_failed`, `suspended`, `resumable`.
