# ibm_sm_public_certificate_configuration_dns_cis

Provides a read-only data source for PublicCertificateConfigurationDNSCloudInternetServices. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_sm_public_certificate_configuration_dns_cis" "sm_public_certificate_configuration_dns_cis" {
    instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
    region        = "us-south"
    name          = "configuration-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `name` - (Required, String) The name of the configuration.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9]*(?:_?-?\\.?[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the PublicCertificateConfigurationDNSCloudInternetServices.
* `cloud_internet_services_apikey` - (String) An IBM Cloud API key that can to list domains in your Cloud Internet Services instance.To grant Secrets Manager the ability to view the Cloud Internet Services instance and all of its domains, the API key must be assigned the Reader service role on Internet Services (`internet-svcs`).If you need to manage specific domains, you can assign the Manager role. For production environments, it is recommended that you assign the Reader access role, and then use the[IAM Policy Management API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-policy-management#create-policy) to control specific domains. For more information, see the [docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-order-certificates#authorize-specific-domains).
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `4` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`.

* `cloud_internet_services_crn` - (String) A CRN that uniquely identifies an IBM Cloud resource.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `512` characters. The minimum length is `9` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^crn:v[0-9](:([A-Za-z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=@\/]|%[0-9A-Z]{2})*){8}$/`.

* `config_type` - (String) Th configuration type.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `public_cert_configuration_ca_lets_encrypt`, `public_cert_configuration_dns_classic_infrastructure`, `public_cert_configuration_dns_cloud_internet_services`, `iam_credentials_configuration`, `private_cert_configuration_root_ca`, `private_cert_configuration_intermediate_ca`, `private_cert_configuration_template`.

* `created_at` - (String) The date when a resource was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `created_by` - (String) The unique identifier that is associated with the entity that created the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `4` characters.

  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `arbitrary`, `imported_cert`, `public_cert`, `iam_credentials`, `kv`, `username_password`, `private_cert`.

* `updated_at` - (String) The date when a resource was recently modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.
