# ibm_project_event_notification

Provides a read-only data source for Project definition. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_project_event_notification" "project_event_notification" {
	id = "072b70cb-4db7-4c5c-bf1b-8d93d422537d"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The unique project ID.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[\\.\\-0-9a-zA-Z]+$/`.
