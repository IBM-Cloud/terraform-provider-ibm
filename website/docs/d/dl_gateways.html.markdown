# ibm_dl_gateways

Import the details of an existing IBM Cloud Infrastructure Direct Link Gateways.  For more information, about IBM Cloud Direct Link, see [getting started with IBM Cloud Direct Link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl).


## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_dl_gateways" "ds_dlgateways" {
}
     
```

## Argument reference
There is no argument reference that you need to specify for the data source. 


## Attribute reference
You can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `gateways` - (String) List of all the Direct Link Gateways in the IBM Cloud infrastructure.

  Nested scheme for `gateways`:
  - `as_prepends` - (List) List of AS Prepend configuration information

    Nested scheme for `as_prepend`:
    - `created_at`- (String) The date and time AS Prepend was created.
    - `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this AS Prepend.
    - `length` - (Integer) Number of times the ASN to appended to the AS Path.
    - `policy` - (String) Route type this AS Prepend applies to. Possible values are `import` and `export`.
    - `prefix` - (String, Optional) Comma separated list of prefixes this AS Prepend applies to. Maximum of 10 prefixes. If not specified, this AS Prepend applies to all prefixes.
    - `updated_at`- (String) The date and time AS Prepend was updated

  - `authentication_key` - (String) BGP MD5 authentication key.
  - `bfd_interval` - (String) Minimum interval in milliseconds at which the local routing device transmits hello packets and then expects to receive a reply from a neighbor with which it has established a BFD session.
  - `bfd_multiplier` - (String) The number of hello packets not received by a neighbor that causes the originating interface to be declared down.
  - `bfd_status` - (String) Gateway BFD status.
  - `bfd_status_updated_at` - (String) Date and time bfd status was updated.
  - `bgp_asn` - (String) Customer BGP ASN.

  - `bgp_status` - (String) The gateway BGP status.
  - `completion_notice_reject_reason` - (String) The reason for completion notice rejection. Only included on a dedicated gateways type with a rejected completion notice.
  - `connection_mode` - (String) Type of network connection that you want to bind to your direct link.
  - `cross_connect_router` - (String) The cross connect router. Only included on a dedicated gateways type..
  - `link_status` - (String) The gateway link status. Only included on a dedicated gateways type.
  - `created_at` - (String) The date and time resource is created.
  - `crn` - (String) The CRN of the gateway.
  - `global` - (Bool) Gateway with global routing as **true** can connect networks outside your associated region.
  - `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the gateway.
