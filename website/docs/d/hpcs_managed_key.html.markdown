# ibm_hpcs_managed_key

Provides a read-only data source for managed_key. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_hpcs_managed_key" "managed_key" {
  instance_id = "76195d24-8a31-4c6d-9050-c35f09375cfb"
  region = "us-east"
  key_id = "d8cc1ef7-d13b-4731-95be-1f7c98c9f524"
  uko_vault = ibm_hpcs_vault.vault.vault_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.
