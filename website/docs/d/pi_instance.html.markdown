# ibm_pi_instance
Retrieve information about a Power Systems Virtual Server instance. For more information, about Power Virtual Server instance, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_instance" "ds_instance" {
  pi_instance_name     = "terraform-test-instance"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```

**Notes**
* Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
* If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  * `region` - `lon`
  * `zone` - `lon04`
  
  Example usage:
  
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
