# ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a backup_recovery_protection_policy. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy" "backup_recovery_protection_policy" {
	protection_policy_id = ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy.backup_recovery_protection_policy_instance.id
	x_ibm_tenant_id = ibm_backup_recovery_protection_policy.backup_recovery_protection_policy_instance.x_ibm_tenant_id
}
