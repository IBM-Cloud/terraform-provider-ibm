The following example retrieves information about the storage details of a volume group that is present in Power Systems Virtual Server.

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_volume_group_storage_details" "ds_volume_group_storage_details" {
  pi_volume_group_id   = "cf2ea8d3-cfc8-40e0-80c9-b096581be676"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```
