# ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger

Provides a read-only data source for cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger" "cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger" {
	pipeline_id = ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger.cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger.pipeline_id
	trigger_id = ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger.cd_tekton_pipeline_trigger.trigger_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `pipeline_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The Tekton pipeline ID.
