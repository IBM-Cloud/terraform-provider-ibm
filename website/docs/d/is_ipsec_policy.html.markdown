# ibm_is_ipsec_policy

Provides a read-only data source for IPsecPolicy. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. For more information, about managing IBM Cloud VPN Gateway and IPsec policy , see [about site-to-site VPN gateways](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=ui#policy-negotiation).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_ipsec_policy" "example" {
  name                     = "my-ipsec-policy"
  authentication_algorithm = "md5"
  encryption_algorithm     = "triple_des"
  pfs                      = "disabled"
}

data "ibm_is_ipsec_policy" "example" {
  ipsec_policy = ibm_is_ipsec_policy.example.id
}
```
```hcl
resource "ibm_is_ipsec_policy" "example" {
  name                     = "my-ipsec-policy"
  authentication_algorithm = "md5"
  encryption_algorithm     = "triple_des"
  pfs                      = "disabled"
}

data "ibm_is_ipsec_policy" "example" {
  name = ibm_is_ipsec_policy.example.name
}
```
## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

- `ipsec_policy` - (Optional, String) The IPsec policy identifier.
    ~> **NOTE** : One of `ipsec_policy` or  `name` is required

- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the ipsec policy
    ~> **NOTE** : One of `ipsec_policy` or  `name` is required
