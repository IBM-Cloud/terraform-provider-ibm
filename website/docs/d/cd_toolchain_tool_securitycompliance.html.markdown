# ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_securitycompliance

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a cd_toolchain_tool_securitycompliance. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

See the [tool integration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-scc) page for more information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_securitycompliance" "cd_toolchain_tool_securitycompliance" {
	tool_id = "9603dcd4-3c86-44f8-8d0a-9427369878cf"
	toolchain_id = data.ibm_cd_toolchain.cd_toolchain.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `tool_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) ID of the tool bound to the toolchain.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-4[a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[89abAB][a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}$/`.
* `toolchain_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) ID of the toolchain.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-4[a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[89abAB][a-fA-F0-9]{3}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}$/`.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the cd_toolchain_tool_securitycompliance.
* `crn` - (String) Tool CRN.

* `href` - (String) URI representing the tool.

* `name` - (String) Name of the tool.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^([^\\x00-\\x7F]|[a-zA-Z0-9-._ ])+$/`.

* `parameters` - (List) Unique key-value pairs representing parameters to be used to create the tool. A list of parameters for each tool integration can be found in the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-integrations">Configuring tool integrations page</a>.
Nested schema for **parameters**:
	* `attachment_id` - (String) An attachment ID. An attachment is configured under a profile to define how a scan will be run. To find the attachment ID, in the browser, in the attachments list, click on the attachment link, and a panel appears with a button to copy the attachment ID. This parameter is only relevant when the `use_profile_attachment` parameter is `enabled`.
	  * Constraints: The value must match regular expression `/^[-0-9a-f]{32,36}$/`.
	* `evidence_namespace` - (String) The kind of pipeline evidence to be displayed in Security and Compliance Center for this toolchain. The values are; `cd` which will use evidence generated by a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, or `cc` which will use evidence generated by a Continuous Compliance (CC) pipeline. The default behavior is to use the CD evidence.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `cd`, `cc`.
	* `evidence_repo_url` - (String) The URL to a Git repository evidence locker. The DevSecOps toolchain templates will collect and store evidence for scans and tasks in an evidence repository. This evidence URL should match the `repo_url` for a Git tool integration in this toolchain. The DevSecOps toolchain goals in the Security and Compliance Center will check the evidence repository for the pass or fail results for those goals.
	* `instance_crn` - (String) The Security and Compliance Center service instance CRN (Cloud Resource Name). It is recommended to provide an instance CRN, but when absent, the oldest service instance will be used. This parameter is only relevant when the `use_profile_attachment` parameter is `enabled`.
	  * Constraints: The value must match regular expression `/^crn:v1:(?:bluemix|staging):public:compliance:[a-zA-Z0-9-]*\\b:a\/[0-9a-fA-F]*\\b:[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}\\b::$/`.
	* `name` - (String) The name for this tool integration, shown on the toolchain page.
	* `profile_name` - (String) The name of a Security and Compliance Center profile. Usually, use the "IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services" predefined profile, which contains the DevSecOps Toolchain rules. Or use a user-authored customized profile that has been configured to contain those rules. This parameter is only relevant when the `use_profile_attachment` parameter is `enabled`.
	* `profile_version` - (String) The version of a Security and Compliance Center profile, in SemVer format, like '0.0.0'. This parameter is only relevant when the `use_profile_attachment` parameter is `enabled`.
	* `scc_api_key` - (String) The IBM Cloud API key used to access the Security and Compliance Center service, for the use profile with attachment setting. This parameter is only relevant when the `use_profile_attachment` parameter is `enabled`. You can use a toolchain secret reference for this parameter. For more information, see [Protecting your sensitive data in Continuous Delivery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_data_security#cd_secure_credentials).
	* `use_profile_attachment` - (String) Set to `enabled` to enable use profile with attachment, so that the scripts in the pipeline can interact with the Security and Compliance Center service to perform pre-deploy validation against compliance rules for Continuous Deployment (CD) and compliance monitoring for Continuous Compliance (CC). When enabled, other parameters become relevant; `scc_api_key`, `instance_crn`, `profile_name`, `profile_version`, `attachment_id`.
	  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `disabled`, `enabled`.

* `referent` - (List) Information on URIs to access this resource through the UI or API.
Nested schema for **referent**:
	* `api_href` - (String) URI representing this resource through an API.
	* `ui_href` - (String) URI representing this resource through the UI.

* `resource_group_id` - (String) Resource group where the tool is located.

* `state` - (String) Current configuration state of the tool.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `configured`, `configuring`, `misconfigured`, `unconfigured`.

* `toolchain_crn` - (String) CRN of toolchain which the tool is bound to.


* `updated_at` - (String) Latest tool update timestamp.
