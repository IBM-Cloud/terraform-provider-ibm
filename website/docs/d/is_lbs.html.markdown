# ibm_is_lbs
Retrieve information of an existing IBM VPC load balancers as a read-only data source. For more information, about VPC load balancer, see [load balancers for VPC overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vs-elb).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_lbs" "example" {
}
```
