# ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret

Provides a read-only data source for an IAM credentials secret. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.
The data source can be defined by providing the secret ID or the secret and secret group names.

## Example Usage

By secret id
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret" "iam_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  secret_id = "0b5571f7-21e6-42b7-91c5-3f5ac9793a46"
}
```


By secret name and group name
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret" "iam_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  name          = "secret-name"
  secret_group_name = "group-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `instance_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The GUID of the Secrets Manager instance.
* `region` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The region of the Secrets Manager instance. If not provided defaults to the region defined in the IBM provider configuration.

## Attribute Reference

* `custom_metadata` - (Map) The secret metadata that a user can customize.

* `description` - (String) An extended description of your secret.To protect your privacy, do not use personal data, such as your name or location, as a description for your secret group.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`.

* `downloaded` - (Boolean) Indicates whether the secret data that is associated with a secret version was retrieved in a call to the service API.

* `labels` - (List) Labels that you can use to search for secrets in your instance.Up to 30 labels can be created.
  * Constraints: The list items must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`. The maximum length is `30` items. The minimum length is `0` items.

* `locks_total` - (Integer) The number of locks of the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum value is `1000`. The minimum value is `0`.

* `service_id` - (String) The service ID under which the API key (see the `api_key` field) is created.If you omit this parameter, Secrets Manager generates a new service ID for your secret at its creation and adds it to the access groups that you assign.Optionally, you can use this field to provide your own service ID if you prefer to manage its access directly or retain the service ID after your secret expires, is rotated, or deleted. If you provide a service ID, do not include the `access_groups` parameter.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `50` characters. The minimum length is `40` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9]*(?:-?[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$/`.

* `service_id_is_static` - (Boolean) Indicates whether an `iam_credentials` secret was created with a static service ID.If it is set to `true`, the service ID for the secret was provided by the user at secret creation. If it is set to `false`, the service ID was generated by Secrets Manager.

* `state` - (Integer) The secret state that is based on NIST SP 800-57. States are integers and correspond to the `Pre-activation = 0`, `Active = 1`,  `Suspended = 2`, `Deactivated = 3`, and `Destroyed = 5` values.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`.

  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `pre_activation`, `active`, `suspended`, `deactivated`, `destroyed`.

* `ttl` - (String) The time-to-live (TTL) or lease duration to assign to generated credentials.For `iam_credentials` secrets, the TTL defines for how long each generated API key remains valid.

* `updated_at` - (String) The date when a resource was recently modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `versions_total` - (Integer) The number of versions of the secret.
