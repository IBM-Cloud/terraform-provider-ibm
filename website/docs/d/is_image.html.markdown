# ibm_is_image
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud Infrastructure image as a read-only data source. For more information, about VPC custom images, see [IBM Cloud Importing and managing custom images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-images).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform

data "ibm_is_image" "example" {
  name = "ibm-centos-7-9-minimal-amd64-12"
}
```
```terraform
data "ibm_is_image" "example" {
  identifier = ibm_is_image.example.id
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source.

- `identifier` - (Optional, String) The id of the image.

    ~> **Note:** `name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.

- `name` - (Optional, String) The name of the image.

    ~> **Note:** `name` and `identifier` are mutually exclusive.

- `encryption_key`-  (String) The CRN of the Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Service root key for this resource.
- `id` - (String) The unique identifier of the image.
- `obsolescence_at` - (String) The obsolescence date and time (UTC) for this image. If absent, no obsolescence date and time has been set.
- `os` - (String) The name of the operating system.
- `operating_system` - (List) The operating system details. 
    
  Nested scheme for `operating_system`:
  - `allow_user_image_creation` - (String) Users may create new images with this operating system.
  - `architecture` - (String) The operating system architecture.
