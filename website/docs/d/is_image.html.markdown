# ibm_is_image
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud Infrastructure image as a read-only data source. For more information, about VPC custom images, see [IBM Cloud Importing and managing custom images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-images).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform

data "ibm_is_image" "example" {
  name = "ibm-centos-7-9-minimal-amd64-12"
}
```
```terraform
data "ibm_is_image" "example" {
  identifier = ibm_is_image.example.id
}
```
