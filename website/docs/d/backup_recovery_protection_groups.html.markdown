# ibm_backup_recovery_protection_groups

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about backup_recovery_protection_groups. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_backup_recovery_protection_groups" "backup_recovery_protection_groups" {
	x_ibm_tenant_id = ibm_backup_recovery_protection_group.backup_recovery_protection_group_instance.x_ibm_tenant_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.
