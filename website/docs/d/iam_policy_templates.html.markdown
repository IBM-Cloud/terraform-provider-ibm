# ibm_iam_policy_template

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about policy_templates under enterprise account_id. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_iam_policy_template" "policy_template" {
	account_id = "enterpriseAccount"
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.

* `account_id` - (Required) Enterprise account ID.

## Attribute Reference

After your data source is created, you can read values from the following attributes.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the policy_template.
* `version` - The policy_template version.
* `account_id` - (String) Enterprise account ID where this template will be created.

* `committed` - (Boolean) Committed status of the template version.

* `description` - (String) Description of the policy template. This is shown to users in the enterprise account. Use this to describe the purpose or context of the policy for enterprise users managing IAM templates.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `300` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^.*$/`.

* `name` - (String) Required field when creating a new template. Otherwise this field is optional. If the field is included it will change the name value for all existing versions of the template.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `30` characters. The minimum length is `1` character.

	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `300` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^.*$/`.
	* `pattern` - (String) Indicates pattern of rule, either 'time-based-conditions:once', 'time-based-conditions:weekly:all-day', or 'time-based-conditions:weekly:custom-hours'.
	  * Constraints: The maximum length is `42` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-z:-]*$/`.
	* `resource` - (List) The resource attributes to which the policy grants access.

		  * Constraints: The minimum length is `1` item.
		Nested schema for **tags**:
			* `key` - (String) The name of an access management tag.
			  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9 _.-]*$/`.
