Provides a read-only data source for cd_tekton_pipeline. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_cd_tekton_pipeline" "cd_tekton_pipeline" {
	pipeline_id = "94619026-912b-4d92-8f51-6c74f0692d90"
