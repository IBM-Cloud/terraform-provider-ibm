# ibm_is_instance
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud virtual server instance  as a read-only data source. For more information, about managing VPC instance, see [about virtual server instances for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "example" {
  name            = "example-subnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
