# ibm_is_instance
Retrieve information of an existing IBM Cloud virtual server instance  as a read-only data source. For more information, about managing VPC instance, see [about virtual server instances for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.
