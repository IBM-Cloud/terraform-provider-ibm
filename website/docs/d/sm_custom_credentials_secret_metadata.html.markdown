# ibm_sm_iam_credentials_secret_metadata

Provides a read-only data source for the metadata of a custom credentials secret. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_sm_custom_credentials_secret_metadata" "my_secret_metadata" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  secret_id = "0b5571f7-21e6-42b7-91c5-3f5ac9793a46"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `instance_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The GUID of the Secrets Manager instance.
* `region` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The region of the Secrets Manager instance. If not provided defaults to the region defined in the IBM provider configuration.
* `endpoint_type` - (Optional, String) - The endpoint type. If not provided the endpoint type is determined by the `visibility` argument provided in the provider configuration.
    * Constraints: Allowable values are: `private`, `public`.
* `secret_id` - (Optional, String) The ID of the secret.
    * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

* `configuration` - (String) The name of the Custom Credentials configuration.

* `created_at` - (String) The date when the secret was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `created_by` - (String) The unique identifier that is associated with the entity that created the secret.

* `crn` - (String) A CRN that uniquely identifies an IBM Cloud resource.

* `custom_metadata` - (Map) The secret metadata that a user can customize.

* `description` - (String) An extended description of your secret.

* `downloaded` - (Boolean) Indicates whether the secret data that is associated with a secret version was retrieved in a call to the service API.

* `labels` - (List) Labels that you can use to search for secrets in your instance.Up to 30 labels can be created.

* `locks_total` - (Integer) The number of locks of the secret.

* `name` - (String) The human-readable name of your secret.

* `next_rotation_date` - (String) The date that the secret is scheduled for automatic rotation.The service automatically creates a new version of the secret on its next rotation date. This field exists only for secrets that have an existing rotation policy.

* `parameters` - (List) The parameters that were passed to the Code Engine job.
  Nested scheme for **parameters**:
  * `integer_values` - (Map) Values of integer parameters.
  * `string_values` - (Map) Values of string parameters.
  * `boolean_values` - (Map) Values of boolean parameters.

* `rotation` - (List) Determines whether Secrets Manager rotates your secrets automatically.
Nested scheme for **rotation**:
    * `auto_rotate` - (Boolean) Determines whether Secrets Manager rotates your secret automatically.Default is `false`. If `auto_rotate` is set to `true` the service rotates your secret based on the defined interval.
    * `interval` - (Integer) The length of the secret rotation time interval.
      * Constraints: The minimum value is `1`.
    * `unit` - (String) The units for the secret rotation time interval.
      * Constraints: Allowable values are: `day`, `month`.

* `secret_group_id` - (String) A UUID identifier, or `default` secret group.

* `secret_type` - (String) The secret type. 

* `state` - (Integer) The secret state that is based on NIST SP 800-57. States are integers and correspond to the `Pre-activation = 0`, `Active = 1`,  `Suspended = 2`, `Deactivated = 3`, and `Destroyed = 5` values.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`.

* `state_description` - (String) A text representation of the secret state.
  * Constraints: Allowable values are: `pre_activation`, `active`, `suspended`, `deactivated`, `destroyed`.

* `ttl` - (String) The time-to-live or lease duration (in seconds) to assign to generated credentials. Minimum duration is 86400 seconds (one day).

* `updated_at` - (String) The date when the secret was recently modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `versions_total` - (Integer) The number of versions of the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum value is `50`. The minimum value is `0`.

* `expiration_date` - (String) The date a secret is expired. The date format follows RFC 3339.
