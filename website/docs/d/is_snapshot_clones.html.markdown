## Example usage

```terraform

data "ibm_is_snapshot_clones" "ds_snapshotclones" {
}

```


## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your data source. 

- `snapshot` - (Required, String) The unique identifier of the snapshot.


## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `clones` - (List) List of snapshots in the IBM Cloud Infrastructure.
  
  Nested scheme for `clones`:
  - `available` - (Bool) Indicates whether this snapshot clone is available for use.
  - `created_at` - (String) The date and time that this snapshot clone was created.
  - `zone` - (String) The zone this snapshot clone resides in.
