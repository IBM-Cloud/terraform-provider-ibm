# ibm_code_engine_app

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about a code_engine_app. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_code_engine_app" "code_engine_app" {
	name = ibm_code_engine_app.code_engine_app_instance.name
	project_id = ibm_code_engine_app.code_engine_app_instance.project_id
}
```
