# ibm_is_public_gateway
Retrieve information of an existing public gateway data source as a read only data source. For more information, about an VPC public gateway, see [about networking](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```


## Example usage

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "example" {
  name = "example-vpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_public_gateway" "example" {
  name = "example-gateway"
  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
  zone = "us-south-1"
}

data "ibm_is_public_gateway" "example" {
  name = ibm_is_public_gateway.example.name
}
```
