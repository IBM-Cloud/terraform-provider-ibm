# ibm_pi_instance_volumes

Retrieves information about the persistent storage volumes that are mounted to a Power Systems Virtual Server instance. For more information, about power instance volume, see [snapshotting, cloning, and restoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-volume-snapshot-clone).

## Example usage

The following example retrieves information about the volumes attached to the `terraform-test-instance` instance.

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_instance_volumes" "ds_volumes" {
  pi_instance_name     = "terraform-test-instance"
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```

### Notes

- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
