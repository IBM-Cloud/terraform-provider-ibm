# ibm_config_aggregator_configurations

Provides a read-only data source to retrieve information about config_aggregator_configurations. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_config_aggregator_configurations" "config_aggregator_configurations" {
	instance_id=var.instance_id
	region=var.region
}
```

## Argument Reference

You can specify the following arguments for this data source.
* `instance_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The GUID of the Configuration Aggregator instance.
* `region` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The region of the Configuration Aggregator instance. If not provided defaults to the region defined in the IBM provider configuration.
* `config_type` - (Optional, String) The type of resource configuration that are to be retrieved.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9 ,\\-_]+$/`.
* `location` - (Optional, String) The location or region in which the resources are created.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `32` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^$|[a-z]-[a-z]/`.
* `resource_crn` - (Optional, String) The crn of the resource.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1000` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9.\\:\/-]+$/`.
* `resource_group_id` - (Optional, String) The resource group id of the resources.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `32` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-]*$/`.
* `service_name` - (Optional, String) The name of the IBM Cloud service for which resources are to be retrieved.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `1` character. The value must match regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9 ,\\-_]+$/`.
