# ibm_sm_username_password_secret

Provides a read-only data source for UsernamePasswordSecret. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.
The data source can be defined by providing the secret ID or the secret and secret group names.

## Example Usage

By secret id
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_username_password_secret" "username_password_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  secret_id = "0b5571f7-21e6-42b7-91c5-3f5ac9793a46"
}
```

By secret name and group name
```hcl
data "ibm_sm_username_password_secret" "username_password_secret" {
  instance_id   = ibm_resource_instance.sm_instance.guid
  region        = "us-south"
  name          = "secret-name"
  secret_group_name = "group-name"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

* `instance_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, String) The GUID of the Secrets Manager instance.
* `region` - (Optional, Forces new resource, String) The region of the Secrets Manager instance. If not provided defaults to the region defined in the IBM provider configuration.
* `endpoint_type` - (Optional, String) - The endpoint type. If not provided the endpoint type is determined by the `visibility` argument provided in the provider configuration.

    * Constraints: The maximum length is `36` characters. The minimum length is `36` characters. The value must match regular expression `/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/`.
* `name` - (Optional, String) The human-readable name of your secret. To be used in combination with `secret_group_name`.
    * Constraints: The maximum length is `256` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9]*(?:_*-*\\.*[A-Za-z0-9]+)*$`.
* `secret_group_name` - (Optional, String) The name of your existing secret group. To be used in combination with `name`.
    * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

* `id` - The unique identifier of the UsernamePasswordSecret.
* `created_at` - (String) The date when a resource was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `created_by` - (String) The unique identifier that is associated with the entity that created the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `128` characters. The minimum length is `4` characters.

* `crn` - (String) A CRN that uniquely identifies an IBM Cloud resource.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `512` characters. The minimum length is `9` characters. The value must match regular expression `/^crn:v[0-9](:([A-Za-z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=@\/]|%[0-9A-Z]{2})*){8}$/`.

* `custom_metadata` - (Map) The secret metadata that a user can customize.

* `description` - (String) An extended description of your secret.To protect your privacy, do not use personal data, such as your name or location, as a description for your secret group.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `1024` characters. The minimum length is `0` characters. The value must match regular expression `/(.*?)/`.

* `downloaded` - (Boolean) Indicates whether the secret data that is associated with a secret version was retrieved in a call to the service API.

* `expiration_date` - (String) The date a secret is expired. The date format follows RFC 3339.

* `labels` - (List) Labels that you can use to search for secrets in your instance.Up to 30 labels can be created.

  * Constraints: The maximum length is `256` characters. The minimum length is `2` characters.

* `next_rotation_date` - (String) The date that the secret is scheduled for automatic rotation.The service automatically creates a new version of the secret on its next rotation date. This field exists only for secrets that have an existing rotation policy.

* `password` - (String) The password that is assigned to the secret.
  * Constraints: The maximum length is `64` characters. The minimum length is `6` characters. The value must match regular expression `/[A-Za-z0-9+-=.]*/`.
