# ibm_is_backup_policy_job

Provides a read-only data source for BackupPolicyJob. For more information, about backup policy in your IBM Cloud VPC, see [Backup policy jobs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policy-jobs).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_is_backup_policy_job" "example" {
	backup_policy_id = ibm_is_backup_policy.example.id
	identifier = "0fe9e5d8-0a4d-4818-96ec-e99708644a58"
}
```

## Argument Reference

Review the argument reference that you can specify for your data source.

- `backup_policy_id` - (Required, String) The backup policy identifier.
- `identifier` - (Required, String) The backup policy job identifier.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all argument references listed, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the BackupPolicyJob.
- `auto_delete` - (Boolean) Indicates whether this backup policy job will be automatically deleted after it completes. At present, this is always `true`, but may be modifiable in the future.
- `auto_delete_after` - (Integer) If `auto_delete` is `true`, the days after completion that this backup policy job will be deleted. This value may be modifiable in the future.
- `backup_policy_plan` - (List) The backup policy plan operated this backup policy job (may be [deleted](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#deleted-resources)).
	
	Nested scheme for `backup_policy_plan`:
	- `deleted` - (List) If present, this property indicates the referenced resource has been deleted and providessome supplementary information.
		
		Nested scheme for `deleted`:
			- `more_info` - (String) Link to documentation about deleted resources.
	- `href` - (String) The URL for this backup policy plan.
	- `id` - (String) The unique identifier for this backup policy plan.

- `href` - (String) The URL for this backup policy job.
- `job_type` - (String) The type of backup policy job.The enumerated values for this property will expand in the future. When processing this property, check for and log unknown values. Optionally halt processing and surface the error, or bypass the backup policy job on which the unexpected property value was encountered.
  - Constraints: Allowable values are: `creation`, `deletion`.
- `resource_type` - (String) The resource type.
- `source_volume` - (List) The source volume this backup was created from (may be [deleted](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/vpc#deleted-resources)).
