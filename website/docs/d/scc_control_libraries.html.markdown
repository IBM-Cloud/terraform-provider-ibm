# ibm_scc_control_library

Retrieve information about a list of scc_control_libraries from a read-only data source. Then, you can reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

~> NOTE: Security Compliance Center is a regional service. Please specify the IBM Cloud Provider attribute `region` to target another region. Else, exporting the environmental variable IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT will also override which region is being targeted for all ibm providers(ex. `export IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT=https://eu-es.compliance.cloud.ibm.com`).

data "ibm_scc_control_libraries" "scc_control_libraries" {
