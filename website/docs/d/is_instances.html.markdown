# ibm_is_instances
Retrieve information of an existing  IBM Cloud virtual server instances as a read-only data source. For more information, about virtual server instances, see [about virtual server instances for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-advanced-virtual-servers).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

**provider.tf**

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}
```

## Example usage

```terraform

data "ibm_is_instances" "example" {
}

```

```terraform

data "ibm_is_instances" "example" {
  vpc_name = "example-vpc"
}

```
