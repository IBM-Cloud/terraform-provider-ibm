# ibm_virtual_serial_numbers

Retrieve information about existing virtual serial numbers as a read-only data source. For more information, about IBM power virtual server cloud, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_virtual_serial_numbers" "ds_virtual_serial_number" {
  pi_cloud_instance_id     = "<cloud instance id>"
  pi_virtual_serial_number = "<virtual serial number>"
}
```

### Notes

- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`

Example usage:
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
