# ibm_scc_report_resources

Retrieve information about report resources from a read-only data source. Then, you can reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

~> NOTE: if you specify the `region` in the provider, that region will become the default URL. Else, exporting the environmental variable IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT will override any URL(ex. `export IBMCLOUD_SCC_API_ENDPOINT=https://us-south.compliance.cloud.ibm.com`).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_scc_report_resources" "scc_report_resources" {
    instance_id = "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444"
    report_id = "report_id"
    status = "compliant"
}
```
