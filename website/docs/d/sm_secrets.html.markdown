# ibm_sm_secrets

Provides a read-only data source for sm_secrets. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_sm_secrets" {
  instance_id   = "6ebc4224-e983-496a-8a54-f40a0bfa9175"
  region        = "us-south"
}
```
