Retrieves information about a volume group. For more information, about managing a volume group, see [moving data to the cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-moving-data-to-the-cloud).

## Example usage
The following example retrieves information about the volume group that is present in Power Systems Virtual Server.

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_volume_group" "ds_volume_group" {
  pi_volume_group_id         = "810b5fde-e054-4577-ab5e-3f866a1f6f66"
  pi_cloud_instance_id       = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
}
```

**Notes**
- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:
  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
