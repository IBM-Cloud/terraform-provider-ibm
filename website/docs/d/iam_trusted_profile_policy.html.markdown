```terraform
resource "ibm_iam_trusted_profile_policy" "policy" {
  profile_id = ibm_iam_trusted_profile_link.iam_trusted_profile_link.profile_id
  roles      = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]

  resources {
    service              = "kms"
    region               = "us-south"
    resource_instance_id = element(split(":", ibm_resource_instance.instance.id), 7)
  }
}

data "ibm_iam_trusted_profile_policy" "policy" {
  profile_id = ibm_iam_trusted_profile_policy.policy.profile_id
  transaction_id = "terrformTrustedPolicy"
}

```
