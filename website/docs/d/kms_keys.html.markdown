# ibm_kms_keys

Retrieves the list of keys from the Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS) and Key Protect services for the given key name. The region parameter in the `provider.tf` file must be set. If region parameter is not specified, `us-south` is used by default. If the region in the `provider.tf` file is different from the Key Protect instance, the instance cannot be retrieved by  Terraform and the  Terraform action fails. For more information, about hs-crypto or key-protect keys, see [getting started tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-getting-started-tutorial).

## Example usage

```terraform
data "ibm_kms_keys" "test" {
  instance_id = "guid-of-keyprotect-or hs-crypto-instance"
}
resource "ibm_cos_bucket" "flex-us-south" {
  bucket_name          = "atest-bucket"
  resource_instance_id = "cos-instance-id"
  region_location      = "us-south"
  storage_class        = "flex"
  key_protect          = data.ibm_kms_keys.test.keys.0.crn
}
```

## Argument reference
Review the argument references that you can specify for your resource.

- `alias` - (Optional, String) The alias of the key.
- `endpoint_type` - (Optional, String) The type of the public or private endpoint to be used for fetching keys.
- `instance_id` - (Required, String) The key-protect instance ID.
- `key_name` - (Optional, String) The name of the key. Only matching name of the keys are retrieved.

## Attribute reference
In addition to all argument reference list, you can access the following attribute references after your data source is created.

- `keys` - (String) Lists the Keys of HPCS or Key-protect instance.

  Nested scheme for `keys`:
  - `aliases` - (String) A list of alias names that are assigned to the key.
  - `crn` - (String) The CRN of the key.
  - `id` - (String) The unique ID for the key.
  - `key_ring_id` - (String) The ID of the key ring that the key belongs to.
  - `name` - (String) The name for the key.
  - `policy` - (String) The policies associated with the key.

    Nested scheme for `policy`:
    - `rotation` - (String) The key rotation time interval in months, with a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 12.

      Nested scheme for `rotation`:
      - `created_by` - (String) The unique ID for the resource that created the policy.
      - `creation_date` - (Timestamp) The date the policy was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      - `id` - (String) The v4 UUID used to uniquely identify the policy resource, as specified by RFC 4122.
      - `interval_month` - (String) The key rotation time interval in months.
      - `last_update_date` - (Timestamp) The date when the policy last replaced or modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      - `updated_by` - (String) The unique ID for the resource that updated the policy.
    - `dual_auth_delete` - (String) The data associated with the dual authorization delete policy.
	    
      Nested scheme for `dual_auth_delete`:
      - `created_by` - (String) The unique ID for the resource that created the policy.
      - `creation_date` - (Timestamp) The date the policy was created. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      - `enabled` - (String) If set to **true**, Key Protect enables a dual authorization policy on the key.
      - `id` - (String) The v4 UUID is used to uniquely identify the policy resource, as specified by RFC 4122.
      - `last_update_date` - (Timestamp)  The date when the policy last replaced or modified. The date format follows RFC 3339.
      - `updated_by` - (String) The unique ID for the resource that updated the policy.
   - `standard_key` - (String) Set the flag **true** for standard key, and **false** for root key. Default value is **false**.
